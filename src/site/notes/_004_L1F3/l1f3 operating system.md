description:
upgrading your metaphysical matrix, the operating system of your being, and therefore, society's.

the core inquiry/object of study here is:
-> what is the nature/structure of reality? what/how/how much can we reprogram of it?

this research aims to very practically solve for these questions:

-> how do you operate in life in a way that's inherently regenerative & disruptive?

-> how do you structure/organize yourself and life around you to behave in a growth-oriented short/closed feedback loop manner?

and building minimum viable prototypes as some answers are discovered.
