#### about

when i was 15 years old, i started constantly asking myself - what is an "optimal" or "better" way to manage my life? what would that look like?

this question led me to several different perspectives, based on different [[philosophical\|philosophical]] stances that lead to very practical consequences. lots of people have explored this in the field of [[topics/lab/personal knowledge management\|personal knowledge management]] (as i share my major influences below), but most of them come from conventional western-centric, [[Modernism\|modern]] worldviews.

over time i learned that it must include several elements - from practical [[_001_MOCs/050 🟩 mid game/080 ⚒ tools MOC\|tools]] and [[ecologies of practices\|ecologies of practices]], to clarified [[_001_MOCs/000 🟣 deep game/010 💠 values & principles MOC\|principles]], [[_001_MOCs/000 🟣 deep game/015 ✨ heuristics & inquiries MOC\|heuristics]], [[topics/alchemy/mental models\|mental models]], [[topics/design/systems\|systems]], [[topics/lab/algorithms\|algorithms]] and [[design patterns\|design patterns]].

i started this investigation in 2015 from a very conventional worldview, by attempting to implement [[_001_MOCs/000 🟣 deep game/010 💠 values & principles MOC\|principles]], [[_001_MOCs/000 🟣 deep game/015 ✨ heuristics & inquiries MOC\|heuristics]] and [[topics/alchemy/mental models\|mental models]] from references like [[farnam street\|farnam street]], [[wait but why\|wait but why]] and [[tim ferriss\|tim ferriss]], and the most structured of them - [[the last safe investment\|the last safe investment]]'s [[models & frameworks/player/S.A.F.E. plan\|S.A.F.E. plan]] into systems and frameworks such as [[david allen\|david allen]]'s [[models & frameworks/lab/getting things done\|getting things done]], [[zettelkasten\|zettelkasten]], [[leo babauta\|leo babauta]]'s [[zen to done\|zen to done]], [[taylor pearson\|taylor pearson]]'s [[purposeful productivity\|purposeful productivity]]. (this was before many contemporary "business gurus" such as [[naval ravikant\|naval ravikant]], [[andrew huberman\|andrew huberman]], [[lex fridman\|lex fridman]] and others have risen in popular culture.)

this evolved through my own work in 2018 when i was learning/working with [[people/references/alchemy/gabriel goffi\|gabriel goffi]] on the [[projects & tools/projects/design/24h system\|24h system]] and then when i dove into [[people/references/lab/tiago forte\|tiago forte]]'s [[patterns/active patterns/knowledge management/building a second brain\|BASB]] ([[patterns/active patterns/knowledge management/building a second brain\|building a second brain]]), [[august bradley\|august bradley]]'s [[models & frameworks/lab/pillars, pipelines & vaults\|pillars, pipelines & vaults]], [[people/references/lab/nick milo\|nick milo]]'s [[LYT\|LYT]], [[tbprocessed/base notes/people/zsolt viczián\|zsolt viczián]]'s [[visual knowledge management system\|visual knowledge management system]].

deeper than that, in the original research and current developments of [[responses/lab/tools for thought\|tools for thought]], there are several [[patterns/pattern collections/knowledge design patterns\|knowledge design frameworks and patterns]] that add rich perspectives to the pile.

now, these are still very much in the tech-oriented/[[responses/lab/knowledge management\|knowledge management]] space. managing life isn't just managing knowledge (as seen in the [[models & frameworks/design/DIKW pyramid\|DIKW pyramid]]),  once again integrating insights from other disciplines, 

at the basis of it all lies [[people/references/alchemy/ken wilber\|ken wilber]]'s work on the [[references/alchemy/integral OS\|integral OS]]. in 2022 my vision collided with [[people/friends/ísis schuarts\|ísis schuarts]]' [[_004_L1F3/l1f3 manager\|l1f3 manager]], drinking inspiration from modern coaching practices and ancestral orientation devices such as the [[i-ching\|i-ching]], [[mahalila\|mahalila]], [[practices/tarot\|tarot]], several [[tbprocessed/base notes/ventures - general/mindvalley\|mindvalley]] elements such as the [[lifebook\|lifebook]], for different modules.

this was also informed by a bunch of [[topics/player/game interfaces\|game interfaces]]/[[patterns/pattern collections/game design patterns\|game design patterns]], and frameworks such as [[rodrigo arantes\|rodrigo arantes]]' [[a jogada\|a jogada]], [[jamie combs\|jamie combs]]' [[models & frameworks/player/fourgames\|fourgames]].

finally, integrating all of these references, around 2022 i started to have glimpses of a "*life management methodology*" that integrated all of these perspectives.

[[people/references/lab/tiago forte\|tiago forte]] and [[anne-laure le cunff\|anne-laure le cunff]] (two influential people in the field) have flirted with [[responses/alchemy/metamodernism\|metamodern]] ideas, as shared in anne-laure's [An introduction to metamodernism: the cultural philosophy of the digital age](https://nesslabs.com/metamodernism)  and tiago's numerous accounts of his [transformative experiences](https://fortelabs.com/blog/a-quest-for-self-knowledge-from-self-help-to-somatic-healing-part-i-opening-my-mind/). but from what i can tell, they're still mostly centered in a rationalist perspective for navigating life.

while going through all that, i kept constantly questioning myself:

> what are or "should be" the design primitives of [[_004_L1F3/core concepts/life management\|life management]]?
> what are the fundamental ways in which we see, relate to and engage with reality?
> what are the fundamental tools that we use to do so?

instead of assuming a bunch of premises widely accepted in modern culture (and just "get on with these simple productivity apps/tricks"), this inquiry clearly came from an inner place of strong dissonance - what's being talked about in media, how "normal lives" are being lived feels off. that's not what i believe in and want for my life.

so this necessarily crosses into deeper [[topics/alchemy/metaphysics\|metaphysical]], [[concepts/alchemy/epistemology\|epistemological]], [[concepts/alchemy/ontology\|ontological]], [[concepts/alchemy/axiology\|axiological]] territory. the [[concepts/design/metacrisis\|metacrisis]] distinctions gave me a vocabulary to talk about that.

yet, i didn't want to get esoteric. i wanted it to work for other people too. so my inquiry remained: how can i create something that is grounded in reality, that is systemic, modular, non-dogmatic, interoperable, fully extensible, customizable and regenerative by design?

very wordy and challenging, yes. but necessary nonetheless.

i wanted it to be minimally opinionated, yet i found the [[topics/design/regeneration\|regenerative]] frame to be a key difference between meaninglessness and unconsciously damaging behaviors to ways of living that are more conscious and life-affirming, so i opted to keep it.

as it's intended to be modular, the ontology of the framework itself is under constant development, but the initial core principles/structures are set in place.

#### the L1F3 ontology

it consists of:

a set of [[concepts/lab/maps of content\|maps of content]], structured under the [[models & frameworks/player/fourgames\|fourgames]] framework, that is in a sense, similar to GTD's [[6 horizons of focus - GTD.png|6 horizons of focus]].
