the l1f3 manager is a [[_001_MOCs/050 🟩 mid game/070 🔩 prototypes MOC\|prototype]] built by [[people/friends/ísis schuarts\|ísis schuarts]] which aimed to be the technological basis of [[_004_L1F3/core concepts/self-management\|self]] and [[topics/lab/personal data management\|personal data management]] within the [[_004_L1F3/l1f3 game\|L1F3 game]].

most of the content on it is in portuguese, but i'll share it below with annotations so you can grasp the essence of it.

it's based on a cycle that she denominated as: [[metrify\|metrify]], [[look\|look]], [[topics/player/learning\|learn]], [[practice\|practice]].

for me, it's easier to think of it as the [[models & frameworks/design/OODA loop\|OODA loop]] - [[perceive\|perceive]], [[orient\|orient]], [[decide\|decide]], [[act\|act]].

it also acts on 4 dimensions - [[physical body\|physical body]], [[mind\|mind]], [[soul\|soul]] and [[concepts/alchemy/spirit\|spirit]]. she works with a few specific spiritual perspectives that i don't fully resonate with, so i also prefer to use the [[models & frameworks/alchemy/5 bodies\|5 bodies]] framework - [[areas/life areas (internal)/physical\|physical]], [[areas/life areas (internal)/intellectual\|intellectual]], [[areas/life areas (internal)/emotional\|emotional]], [[areas/life areas (internal)/energetic\|energetic]] and [[areas/life areas (internal)/archetypal\|archetypal]]. 

in her framework/prototype, there are 6 dimensions of [[_004_L1F3/core concepts/life management\|life management]]: [[time management\|time management]], [[energy management\|energy management]], [[emotional management\|emotional management]], [[activities management\|activities management]], [[needs management\|needs management]] and [[life timeline management\|life timeline management]].

she introduces these at the [adam kadmon instute playbook](https://adamkadmon-institute.my.canva.site/playbook) (beta website).

below is an example of a [[_004_L1F3/core concepts/life management\|life management]] view in practice, focused on one's [[field of view\|field of view]], clarifying and matching [[_001_MOCs/075 🔴🟠🟡 short game/099 📆 activities MOC\|activities]] & [[_002_toolkit/daily/time blocks\|time blocks]]:

she introduces it in [a series of 13 videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLliJTfwEBewrsBny4TAusQGNBfgzWB8QN) that are over 1h long each, as part of a bigger presentation of her overarching vision. the videos ["corporate care: why my next step is to create a care structure for organizations?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVoU_SJXS2c&list=PLliJTfwEBewrsBny4TAusQGNBfgzWB8QN&index=5), "[the art of collaboration: how to join the pieces of the puzzle to actualize the planetary transition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDS64SBwVkY&list=PLliJTfwEBewrsBny4TAusQGNBfgzWB8QN&index=6)", and [life management: how to metrify routine and direct your energy to transform your reality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nxo8hX97ojk&list=PLliJTfwEBewrsBny4TAusQGNBfgzWB8QN&index=7) go into the different parts of it in more depth.

the prototype was developed using both a SQL-like language she created and a few [[excel\|excel]] spreadsheets for the time being. the goal is for it to be open-source, but as it needed initial funding and a lot more development, she opted for selling a hands-on implementation package as a kind of personal assistance service.

i don't know if/how/when this project will see the light of day, since ísis is involved with a bunch of other things, but i find a good deal of its design very comprehensive.
