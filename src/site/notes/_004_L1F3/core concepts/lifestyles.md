#### about

i believe the design of our lifestyles has a dramatic impact on our lives, and this is something that isn't discussed or theorized nearly enough, not even in circles that talk about [[_004_L1F3/core concepts/self-transformation\|self-transformation]], [[social change\|social change]], [[topics/design/regeneration\|regeneration]] or [[_004_L1F3/core concepts/civilization design\|civilization design]] in general.

the term "[[topics/design/lifestyle design\|lifestyle design]]" did rise in popularity with digital nomads and such, but the major resources that emerged with it, like [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1usâ€™ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/archive/databases/contacts master list/contacts master list/tim ferriss\|tim ferriss]]' [[4-hour workweek\|4-hour workweek]] and [[references/design/designing your life\|designing your life]] are tremendously superficial, besides carrying very euro-centric biases.

the task of "designing a lifestyle" has a [[sociological\|sociological]], [[topics/design/anthropology\|anthropological]], [[philosophical\|philosophical]] nature, and it's also a very practical tool for self-reflection on the life-long path of [[self-unfoldment\|self-unfoldment]].

###### so here are a few of my key inquiries:

- [[inquiries & heuristics/what are the common types;categories of lifestyles - and what do they tell us about how our society is organized\|what are the common types;categories of lifestyles - and what do they tell us about how our society is organized]]?

	**the problem with how we (don't) think about lifestyles are two:**
	
	1) unconscious, ineffective design
	 
	2) systemic fragility, messed up inputs (energy) and outputs (waste).
	
	we're not taking into account the externalities of our lifestyles. their real costs are invisibilized (energy, buying, disposing, hiring, firing)...
	
	i.e. people's lifestyles often reflect their [[concepts/alchemy/values\|values]], or more deeply, [[effective value memes\|effective value memes]].
	
	examples: [[digital nomadism\|digital nomadism]] <> [[minimalism\|minimalism]] (intersection) <> [[topics/design/regeneration\|regenerative]]/[[holistic\|holistic]]... a higher level of intentionality around their [[energy management\|energy management]] and [luiz smth design].

- [[inquiries & heuristics/who are the highly intentional people with highly intentional lifestyles\|who are the highly intentional people with highly intentional lifestyles]]?

- [[what are we optimizing our lifestyles towards?\|what are we optimizing our lifestyles towards?]] / [[inquiries & heuristics/what are the characteristics of a disruptive lifestyle\|what are the characteristics of a disruptive lifestyle]]?

##### more early-stage reflections:

many people talk about lifestyle design, but from a narrow perspective. i unfortunately haven't found anyone questioning it deeply enough to bring insights, as to, for example, what is a [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1usâ€™ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/concepts & frameworks/lifestyle\|lifestyle]], really?

one of the perspectives i arrived at is that a lifestyle is just an emergent property of a being living its life. a lifestyle is a part of the system. it's just how you - consciously and unconsciously - choose to live within a model of reality you've constructed.

but what other properties, elements, aspects exist in a being's life?

the more we are aware of such things and open to experimenting with and integrating these unconscious elements, the broader our sense of being becomes and the more proficient we are at life.

on the note of [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1usâ€™ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/concepts & frameworks/lifestyle\|lifestyle]], [[concepts/alchemy/self\|self]] or [[mind\|mind]] *design*, since we don't know how much we don't know, we also need to question our ability to [[terms/design\|design]] things. what may seem like a functional, beautiful design, in practice be the opposite.

how often do we tell ourselves that we want something, when in fact, what we truly want is something else?

instead of using a rigid "i'm going to plan every detail of myself and my life" approach, it's possible to experiment with the balance of the known and the unknown. 

that's how i came to use the term "management". it's the constant balancing between control and no control. order and chaos.

that's one tricky area to navigate though, as many people talk about this process of design and materialization through the lenses of manifestation and law of attraction, which although packed with insights, often has a lot of magical thinking involved.
