i believe the subject of our lifestyles has a dramatic impact on our lives and it is not nearly discussed enough when talking about [[concepts/alchemy/self-transformation\|self-transformation]], [[social change\|social change]] or [[_004_L1F3/core concepts/civilization design\|civilization design]] in general.

the term "[[topics/architect;design/lifestyle design\|lifestyle design]]" did rise in popularity with digital nomads and such, but the major resources that emerged with it, like [[tim ferriss\|tim ferriss]]' [[4-hour workweek\|4-hour workweek]] and [[references/design/designing your life\|designing your life]] are tremendously superficial, besides carrying very eurocentric biases.

this is both a [[sociological\|sociological]], [[topics/architect;design/anthropology\|anthropological]] and a practical self-reflective analysis towards [[life improvement\|life improvement]].

###### so here are a few of my inquiries:

- [[inquiries & heuristics/what are the common types;categories of lifestyles - and what do they tell us about how our society is organized\|what are the common types;categories of lifestyles - and what do they tell us about how our society is organized]]?

	**the problem with how we (don't) think about lifestyles are two:**
	
	1) unconscious, ineffective design
	 
	2) systemic fragility, messed up inputs (energy) and outputs (waste).
	
	we're not taking into account the externalities of our lifestyles. their real costs are invisibilized (energy, buying, disposing, hiring, firing)...
	
	i.e. people's lifestyles often reflect their [[values\|values]], or more deeply, [[effective value memes\|effective value memes]].
	
	examples: [[digital nomadism\|digital nomadism]] <> [[minimalism\|minimalism]] (intersection) <> [[topics/architect;design/regeneration\|regenerative]]/[[holistic\|holistic]]... a higher level of intentionality around their [[energy management\|energy management]] and [luiz smth design].

- [[inquiries & heuristics/who are the highly intentional people with highly intentional lifestyles\|who are the highly intentional people with highly intentional lifestyles]]?

- [[what are we optimizing our lifestyles towards?\|what are we optimizing our lifestyles towards?]] / [[inquiries & heuristics/what are the characteristics of a disruptive lifestyle\|what are the characteristics of a disruptive lifestyle]]?
