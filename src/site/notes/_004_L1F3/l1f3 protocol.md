the L1F3 protocol is an open-source, distributed, modular, interoperable protocol for playing life - individually and together - under early/active design.

the main difference between it and [[initiatives, orgs & communities/architect;design/metagame.wtf\|metagame.wtf]] is that metagame is built on top of [[ceramic network\|ceramic network]], so it's not interoperable with [[initiatives, orgs & communities/lab/holochain\|holochain]], [[urbit\|urbit]], [[oasis API\|oasis API]] and other emergent protocols.
