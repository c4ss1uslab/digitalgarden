the L1F3 protocol is an open-source, distributed, modular, interoperable protocol for [[topics/player/play\|playing]] life - individually and together - under early/active design.

the main difference between it and [[initiatives, orgs & communities/architect;design/metagame.wtf\|metagame.wtf]] is that metagame is built on top of [[ceramic network\|ceramic network]], so it's not interoperable with [[initiatives, orgs & communities/lab/holochain\|holochain]], [[urbit\|urbit]], [[oasis API\|oasis API]] and other emergent protocols.

#### why build a protocol?

because protocols are at the foundational layers of how our civilization/social coordination operates today. if we want different ([[topics/architect;design/regeneration\|regenerative]]) outcomes, we need civilizational systems that are regenerative by design. the protocol is a mechanism that allows for [[interoperability\|interoperability]] and [[terms/collaboration\|collaboration]] across the design of various [[topics/architect;design/systems\|systems]].

#### development status

at the core of the [[_004_L1F3/l1f3 protocol\|l1f3 protocol]] lies a modular, extendable [[_004_L1F3/l1f3 management ontology\|l1f3 management ontology]]. i'm currently in the process of refining/testing the ontology
