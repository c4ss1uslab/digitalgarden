**what is L1F3?**

L1F3/l1f3 is short for L1F3.stream - an early-stage DAO/ecosystem envisioned by [[people/friends/ísis schuarts\|ísis schuarts]], and the major initiative behind all "[[L1F3 projects\|L1F3 projects]]".

L1F3.stream is conceived as primarily the technology branch of a larger organism, comprised of the [[initiatives, orgs & communities/alchemy/adam kadmon institute\|adam kadmon institute]], mostly focused on [[topics/alchemy/spirituality\|spirituality]] and [[personal development\|personal development]], and the [[initiatives, orgs & communities/alchemy/instituto samaúma\|samaúma institute]], mostly focused on regenerating the [[topics/regen/earth regeneration\|planet]] and [[regeneration of individuals\|individuals]].

in march 2022, [[people/friends/ísis schuarts\|ísis]] and i spent a month together cohering and trying to find alignment to work on these initiatives - but ultimately our priorities were different, so we decided to work separately towards the same vision.

we still have a good relationship and we share a lot of the same visions for L1F3 as a whole, but often differ on the path to get there, so we've been both working towards advancing this ecosystem in our own ways.

although L1F3 is an umbrella that holds big part of my vision/the work that i do, i don't claim to own it. all projects and prototypes i'm developing aim to be in alignment with L1F3.stream (if it actualizes itself as this brand), but can also be integrated into many other projects and ecosystems as contributions to [[concepts/design/public goods\|public goods]].
