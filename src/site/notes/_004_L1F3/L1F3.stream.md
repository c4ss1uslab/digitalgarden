L1F3/l1f3 is short for L1F3.stream - an early-stage DAO/ecosystem envisioned by [[people/friends/Ã­sis schuarts\|Ã­sis schuarts]], and the major initiative behind all "[[L1F3 projects\|L1F3 projects]]".

L1F3.stream is conceived as primarily the technology branch of a larger organism, comprised of the [[initiatives, orgs & communities/alchemy/adam kadmon institute\|adam kadmon institute]], mostly focused on [[topics/alchemy/spirituality\|spirituality]] and [[personal development\|personal development]], and the [[initiatives, orgs & communities/alchemy/instituto samaÃºma\|samaÃºma institute]], mostly focused on regenerating the [[topics/regen/earth regeneration\|planet]] and [[regeneration of individuals\|individuals]].

in march 2022, [[people/friends/Ã­sis schuarts\|Ã­sis]] and i spent a month together cohering and trying to find alignment to work on these initiatives - but ultimately our priorities were different, so we decided to work separately towards the same vision.

we still have a good relationship and we share a lot of the same visions for L1F3 as a whole, but often have relationship frictions & different views on the path to get there, so we've been both working towards advancing this ecosystem in our own ways.

although L1F3 is an umbrella that holds big part of my vision/the work that i do, i don't claim to own it. all projects and prototypes i'm developing aim to be in alignment with L1F3.stream (if it actualizes itself as this brand), but can also be integrated into many other projects and ecosystems as contributions to [[concepts/design/public goods\|public goods]].
