L1F3.stream (L1F3/l1f3 for short) is an early-stage [[nonprofit\|nonprofit]] [[terms/DAOs\|DAO]]/ecosystem envisioned by [[people/friends/Ã­sis schuarts\|Ã­sis schuarts]] and the major initiative behind all "[[L1F3 projects\|L1F3 projects]]".

L1F3.stream is conceived as primarily the [[topics/design/technology\|technology]] arm of a larger organism, comprised of the [[initiatives, orgs & communities/alchemy/adam kadmon institute\|adam kadmon institute]], mostly focused on [[concepts/alchemy/consciousness development\|consciousness development]], and the [[initiatives, orgs & communities/alchemy/instituto samaÃºma\|samaÃºma institute]], mostly focused on [[topics/regen/earth regeneration\|earth]] and [[regeneration of individuals\|individual]] [[topics/design/regeneration\|regeneration]].

in march 2022, [[people/friends/Ã­sis schuarts\|Ã­sis]] and i spent a month together [[coherence\|cohering]] and trying to find [[alignment\|alignment]] to work on these initiatives - but ultimately our [[priorities\|priorities]] and immediate [[concepts/alchemy/needs\|needs]] were different, so we decided to work separately towards the same [vision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EAfmbN3yBE).

we haven't been in close contact since then, yet we share a lot of the same visions and hopes for L1F3 as a whole. even though we've had relationship frictions & different views on the path to get there, we've been both working towards advancing this ecosystem in our own ways.

also, L1F3 is an umbrella term that holds most of my vision/the work that i do, but i don't claim to own it. all [[_001_MOCs/050 ðŸŸ© mid game/060 ðŸ—¡ projects MOC\|projects]] and [[_001_MOCs/050 ðŸŸ© mid game/070 ðŸ”© prototypes MOC\|prototypes]] i'm developing aim to be in alignment with the L1F3.stream vision (if it actualizes itself as this brand), but they can also be integrated into many other projects and ecosystems as contributions to [[concepts/design/public goods\|public goods]].
