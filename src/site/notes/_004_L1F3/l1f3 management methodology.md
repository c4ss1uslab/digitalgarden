since 2015, i've been asking myself - is there an "optimal" or "better" way to manage my life? what would that look like?

i experimented with tons of systems and frameworks, such as [[zettelkasten\|zettelkasten]], [[david allen\|david allen]]'s GTD 5 horizons, [[people/nick milo\|nick milo]] LYT's [[MOCs\|MOCs]], [[august bradley\|august bradley]]'s [[models & frameworks/PPV\|PPV]], plus my own work in 2018 with [[people/gabriel goffi\|gabriel goffi]] and in 2022 with [[people/ísis schuarts\|ísis schuarts]] (life manager), and by drinking inspiration from [[people/ken wilber\|ken wilber]]'s work on the [[concepts/integral OS\|integral OS]], gaming interfaces/models, and jamie combs' [[models & frameworks/fourgames\|fourgames]], i finally found a "*life management methodology*" that works for me.

yet, i wanted it to work for other people too. so my inquiry remained: how can i create something that is grounded in reality, that is systemic, modular, non-dogmatic, interoperable, fully extensible, customizable and regenerative by design?

i wanted it to be minimally opinionated, yet i found this regenerative frame to be a key difference between meaninglessness and unconsciously damaging behaviors to ways of living that are more conscious and life-affirming, so i opted to keep it.

as it's modular, the ontology is under constant development, but the core principles/structures are set in place.

##### the L1F3 framework

it consists of:

a set of [[MOCs\|MOCs]], structured under [[4 games\|4 games]] that are similar to GTD's [[5 horizons\|5 horizons]].

inspired by the [[models & frameworks/OODA loop\|OODA loop]], i also created a few spaces to visualize/understand/improve meta-cognitive processes:
- [[sensing hub\|sensing hub]]
- [[sensemaking hub\|sensemaking hub]]
- [[_002_toolkit/008 🕹 decision hub\|008 🕹 decision hub]]
- action hub (task management) - ok
- learning hub (learning management) - ok



inspired by the [[models & frameworks/fourgames\|fourgames]] framework, there are also pages categorized according to the descriptions of their games:

🟣 [[concepts/deep game\|deep game]]:
- [[mystery\|mystery]]
- [[Identity\|Identity]] (archetypes)
- [[metaphor\|metaphor]]

and finally, inspired by [[references/player/anime/solo leveling\|solo leveling]]/[[nanomachine\|nanomachine]]'s player system and [[references/player/anime/sword art online\|sword art online]]'s yui/iron man's [[jarvis\|jarvis]], i created the [[_002_toolkit/000 ⛓ l1f3 player toolkit\|L1F3 player toolkit]] - i.e. a toolbox for playing life in more conscious, effective, collaborative, fun and purposeful ways.
