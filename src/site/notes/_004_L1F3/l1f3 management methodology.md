#### about

since 2015, i've been asking myself - is there an "optimal" or "better" way to manage my life? what would that look like?

and then from learning lots of [[topics/alchemy/mental models\|mental models]], simple [[_001_MOCs/000 🟣 deep game/015 ✨ heuristics & inquiries MOC\|heuristics]] and operating [[_001_MOCs/000 🟣 deep game/010 💠 values & principles MOC\|principles]], i kept experimenting with tons of systems and frameworks, such as [[zettelkasten\|zettelkasten]], [[david allen\|david allen]]'s [[models & frameworks/lab/getting things done\|getting things done]], [[leo babauta\|leo babauta]]'s [[zen to done\|zen to done]], [[people/references/lab/nick milo\|nick milo]] [[linking your thinking\|linking your thinking]], [[august bradley\|august bradley]]'s [[models & frameworks/lab/PPV\|PPV]], [[taylor pearson\|taylor pearson]]'s [[purposeful productivity\|purposeful productivity]], [[rodrigo arantes\|rodrigo arantes]]' [[a jogada\|a jogada]], my own work in 2018 with [[people/references/alchemy/gabriel goffi\|gabriel goffi]] and in 2022 with [[people/friends/ísis schuarts\|ísis schuarts]] ([[life manager\|life manager]]), drinking inspiration from [[people/references/alchemy/ken wilber\|ken wilber]]'s work on the [[references/alchemy/integral OS\|integral OS]], ancestral orientation devices such as the [[i-ching\|i-ching]], [[mahalila\|mahalila]], [[practices/tarot\|tarot]], as well as several different [[tbprocessed/base notes/tools;products - general/notion\|notion]] workflows/templates once these started to pop up, og [[patterns/pattern collections/knowledge design patterns\|knowledge design frameworks and patterns]], a bunch of [[topics/player/game interfaces\|game interfaces]]/[[patterns/pattern collections/game design patterns\|design patterns]], and [[jamie combs\|jamie combs]]' [[models & frameworks/player/fourgames\|fourgames]] framework - finally - around 2022 i started to have glimpses of a "*life management methodology*" that worked for me.

while going through all that, i kept constantly questioning myself:

> what are or "should be" the design primitives of [[concepts/design/life management\|life management]]?
> what are the fundamental ways in which we see, relate to and engage with reality?
> what are the fundamental tools that we use to do so?

instead of assuming a bunch of premises widely accepted in modern culture (and just "get on with these simple productivity apps/tricks"), this inquiry clearly came from an inner place of strong dissonance - what's being talked about in media, how "normal lives" are being lived feels off. that's not what i believe in and want for my life.

so this necessarily crosses into deeper [[topics/alchemy/metaphysics\|metaphysical]], [[concepts/alchemy/epistemology\|epistemological]], [[concepts/alchemy/ontology\|ontological]], [[concepts/alchemy/axiology\|axiological]] territory.

yet, i didn't want to get esoteric. i wanted it to work for other people too. so my inquiry remained: how can i create something that is grounded in reality, that is systemic, modular, non-dogmatic, interoperable, fully extensible, customizable and regenerative by design?

very wordy and challenging, yes. but necessary nonetheless.

i wanted it to be minimally opinionated, yet i found this [[topics/architect;design/regeneration\|regenerative]] frame to be a key difference between meaninglessness and unconsciously damaging behaviors to ways of living that are more conscious and life-affirming, so i opted to keep it.

as it's intended to be modular, the ontology of the framework itself is under constant development, but the initial core principles/structures are set in place.

#### the L1F3 framework

it consists of:

a set of [[concepts/lab/maps of content\|maps of content]], structured under the [[models & frameworks/player/fourgames\|fourgames]] framework, that is in a sense, similar to GTD's [[6 horizons of focus - GTD.png|6 horizons of focus]].
