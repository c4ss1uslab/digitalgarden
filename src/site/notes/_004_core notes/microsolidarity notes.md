intros:

martin (berlin) - organizational design. finding tribe that cares.

victor (san jose) - love it! metacrisis, vibecafe.xyz -> catalyze dyads, crew formation.

——————
3 things we can talk about:

1. Information: about facts, data...
2. Personal: about feelings, values...
3. Interpersonal: about our relationship...

exercise -> observe (& follow) the sensor of aliveness/curiosity.

introduce yourself without talking about your job. talk about your real/deepest you (to the point you feel comfortable). feel the vibe. what amount of trust is there. how deep can we go?

jelger (bergerac, france) - telegram

- emergence, biological systems, music, improv, facilitation, group dynamics. play to develop a realization of true value.

life itself

-----------
parrot / paraphrase -> why do i loathe it?

(boring. assumes low level of presence/consciousness? activates a kind of focus/striving to prove myself/self-evaluation [school-like])

the guy from -> artem zen. psilocybin. rap.

❓What's going on for you right now? (Mentally, physically, emotionally, etc.)

🔍 Try giving voice to some of your different parts using the following sentence stems
""A part of me is feeling/thinking...""
""I notice one voice saying...""
""A part of me wants to...""

(Remember your curiosity and paraphrasing)

📝 Write some reflections in your own journal:

🔍 How did it feel today to be in the different groups? What did you notice about the different relational practices? What did you notice about yourself?

i wasn't in my 100% (sleep + coffee), but i still felt like i kind of matched the energy level of the group. so i feel that if i were in my 100%, i'd feel/be more connected, but at the same time, i'd feel a little disconnect in energy. as if maybe i was bringing too much energy/excitement that wasn't met by the group. (or maybe it'd be by some people, but not others).

i'm not sure what really makes us feel connected or not, even though we might have a lot of interests in common. e.g.: simon/christina from RF7.

it seems like something like openness/interest in the other's experiences. but it's a very subtle thing.

++ i appreciate the sharing of practices and light/fluid facilitation.

++ i really like the parts sharing. shows the complexity of the individual. and if clear that you're not looking for advice, create a deep context for connection (with deeper parts of our selves).
IFS -> unguarding into more warmth, compassion, heartful sharing.

other resonant shares:

"the "introduce myself without mentioning your job" exercise really helped me ease into a state of being myself rather than presenting myself."

"it felt so sweet and warm. each person is so full hearted and unguarded. i feel at ease."

“community begins with relationship”

"rapid mixing & connecting"

#### session 2

(3-min journaling)
❓It's one year from today, you're in the best possible community/network/group. 
- What does it look like?

(15-min sharing)
After each sharing (3'), listening partners can reflect back (2') what they hear is important to the speaker, e.g. ideals, principles, values, desires, needs...

5' per person

[1] meta-systems, not just random projects.
my alchemy, architect, art, builder, player/adventurous.

am i ready to start creating it? building it / doing it no matter what it takes, since it's gonna be worth it...

- "being a leader"
- "16-person co-living community"

(2-min journaling)
❓What's blocking you from having the community that you want?

damn. i guess building it is just quite a challenging thing... requires coordination w/ people (on worldviews, values, communication) & money alignment. lots of complexity.

(4-min client sharing, 5 min consultant discussion [behind the scenes], 2 client sharing relfections]
[bts] = turning the camera/mic off.

hearing from my challenge:

consensus building challenges -> 6 people, who have more skin in the game.
meeting people is a strength. a way to go through blocks.

—————————

📝 Write some reflections in your journal about your experience today

🔍 How did it feel today to be Client and Consultant?
🔍 What was made possible in today's relational practices?

love to be in the space of the client. it's great to receive conscious, loving attention to our challenges.
being a consultant was also fun, as an opportunity to put our awareness/knowledge/strenghts to be available for others.

i was able to have a more firm ground in the direction of building the community i envision to be part of.

"beautiful structure. beautiful opportunity. it'll be different every time."
"we got into the details. and that's really lovely"
"it's really cool to hear what your friends have to say, while they clearly care"

"map of relational practices"
