## welcome! what should you expect?

this is my digital garden - a space in which i write, tend to and share my lab notes. i.e. the notes i use daily to manage my research, projects and life as whole.

there are two ways you can navigate this:

1) through a structured, organized, narrative lens, which is how i've written my foundational essays
2) through a loose, experimental, exploratory navigation, which is how the notes exist in this space

## research consolidation

if you grew up playing games (or maybe even if you didn't), as you transitioned into adulthood you might have faced the utterless lack of fun of the "job market", or even, of modern life in general.

much like games themselves, playing our societal games can be enlivening or numbing. they can inspire, help us learn and evolve, or disconnect us from ourselves, others and reality itself, falling prey to our own automatic, unconscious behaviors.

you might have asked - what games do i actually want to play in my life? why isn't life more like a game? or, why isn't there a game of life yet?

these inquiries were my starting point, back in 2015. and it led me down many paths of discovery and self-transformation. this collection of essays is my attempt to consolidate the results of this research and provide some directions to the question:

| how can we create more fulfilling and meaningful lives in our present day and age?
### essays

🌿 [[life as play & ontological design as a revolutionary practice\|life as play & ontological design as a revolutionary practice]]
🌱 [[the rise of lo-fi/ambient content and the evolution of the creator, curation & experience economies\|the rise of lo-fi/ambient content and the evolution of the creator, curation & experience economies]]

note: these articles are still under construction/revision, and the emojis represent their level of maturity.
🌲 = evergreen | 🌿 = budding | 🌱 = seedling

in the above, i introduce several concepts, challenges, references, projects and prototypes in a narrative, structured way.

alternatively, if you want to explore these topics on your own, you can see below a high-level skeleton of the main projects, prototypes and references i've been working with. some of these will be more structured pages, others will be links to resources, others are still blank. explore according to your own judgment! 🙃

on the contents below, the emojis mean different things. here's their caption:

### additional information

#### where am i? / what is this page?

this is my version of a digital garden. it's a space where i share both the core essays that introduce the fundamental aspects of my research, as well as a access to the web of notes that i use daily to manage my research, projects and life as whole.

"a digital garden is something inbetween a personal blog and a wiki. it's a collection of evolving notes, essays, and ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date. they're inherently exploratory – posts are linked through contextual associations (bi-directional links). they aren't refined or complete - posts can be published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. they're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal "blogs" we're used to encountering on the web."

if you want to know more, you can check out maggie appleton's amazing content for [a brief history & ethos of the digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) and [an extensive list of digital gardening tools and gardeners](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners).

a digital garden can also be seen as part of someone's [[second brain\|second brain]], or a layer beyond it, a "[[areas/personal spaces/outer spaces/third brain\|third brain]]", so to say.

the structure i use for this garden is very simple. there are [[_000_MOCs/035 🗺 topics MOC\|topics]] and [[growth stages\|growth stages]].

keep in mind, the notes on display here are my lab notes. they're meant for personal use first, not display. most notes will be unfinished, poorly formatted and not polished, but they're still relevant/interesting enough that i choose to share them. :)

if you want to see my more refined content, you can check my outputs like my [newsletter](https://c4ss1us.substack.com/), [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/c4ss1us.l1f3/), [twitter](https://twitter.com/c4ss1usl1f3) (now X), and [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@c4ss1usl1f3). this is a behind-the-scenes view into my world and second brain.

#### how do I navigate this vault?

follow your curiosity. i use indexes such as the maps of content (MOCs), but you can also explore notes by hopping between links.

#### how do I make my own garden?

i edit this using obsidian, a note-taking software that I use for my [second brain](https://maggieappleton.com/basb). You can start using the app by downloading it for free at [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md). there are many tutorials and possible advanced setups, but for starters, i recommend nick milo's ["obsidian for beginners" youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3NaIVgSlAVLHty1-NuvPa9V0b0UwbzBd) and his [LYT obsidian toolkit](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/_Start+Here).

to host my notes, i use the [obsidian digital garden plugin](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/) .

#### how can i be in the loop for new content and updates on these projects?

the way you can be more 'in the know' is to join a whatsapp group i've created, in which i only occasionally share updates, to a small group of friends. i'm leaving it open for new co-conspirators as well right now, as a way to approximate our relationship if you're really interested in these topics.
