## hello! welcome to my digital garden! 🌷

![garden.jpeg|650](/img/user/garden.jpeg)
*ps: in case you arrived here but don't know who i am, you can find [👨🏻‍🎤 an introduction to my life, self and work here](https://c4ss1us.notion.site/c4ss1us/c4ss1us-hello-WIP-71130006ff1c42f69a32b7a46808a290).*

###### ❔ what should you expect from this page?

this is a living space in which i plant, tend to and share my "lab notes" 🧪.
i.e. the notes i use to manage and share about my research, projects and life as whole.

*notes have 3 growth stages:* 🌱 seedling, 🌿 budding and 🌲 evergreen.

there are two ways you can navigate this space:

1) 🗺 a structured, organized, narrative way, in which i share the foundational concepts, references, tools and discoveries of my research/learning/work.
2) 🕸 a loose, experimental, self-directed navigation on a topic-based index of notes, which is how the notes are planted in this space.

choose your path below!

## 1) my research - structured way

![research overview 1.png|700](/img/user/research%20overview%201.png)
(*clickable soon!* *for now, you'll find an index below.*)

address the metacrisis and enable new lifestyles/ways of being.

my research intends to address the inquiries:

> **1) how can we create art, technology and games in service of consciousness development and ecosystems regeneration?**

*a.k.a. how can we develop systems and structures to support life on earth?*

> **2) how can we transform life into a game?**

*but not any kind of game.* a game that's deeply fun, collaborative, challenging, meaningful and fulfilling. a game that honors the beauty and mystery of life, that challenges and supports us to discover ourselves, develop our potential, and share our gifts with others.

##### the backstory

this investigation started for me back in 2014, as i was a 15-year-old trying to figure out a career to follow or what to do in the future. unable to conceive of a single path to follow or a single topic to study, i was jumping around exploring possibilities until i had my first startling realization about life and the world we live in:

> i can't predict who i'll be in 5-10 years, much less what the world will look like by then. so it's not about what i do right now, but about being able to learn whatever's necessary when it's necessary.
>
> so it's about [[learning how to learn\|learning how to learn]]. so i can recognize why, when and how to do something.

essentially, this realization gave me a sense that no single project or topic was "the most important" in my life. **my own life is my biggest, most important project.**

(which later on can be challenged - as in there's value in being devoted to something bigger than yourself - yet, in terms of [[first principles\|first principles]], if your life isn't your n° 1 priority, you may not be able to survive to dedicate yourself to that thing, or anything else)

so it's not about being a narcissist and putting your desires and priorities above everyone else's, but recognizing that the quality of anything you do or achieve is determined by how you're choosing to live your life.

the less focus, attention and awareness you have over your own life, the more unconscious and automatic behaviors you'll have, that may not be leading you to where you really want to be.

that's how for me, the object of study became the subject (myself), and the subjects (i wanted to learn) became just objects for my subject.

all this made me start questioning:

- why are there hundreds of project management tools, but pretty much no "life management tools"? should i just use project management tools to manage my life?

that's how i discovered [[getting things done\|GTD]] and lots of [[coaching tools\|coaching tools]] at the time, but this didn't satistfy me at all. i grew up playing games, so i was used to having lots of [[interfaces\|interfaces]] and tools such as [[maps\|maps]], [[dashboards\|dashboards]], [[cheatsheets\|cheatsheets]], [[wikis\|wikis]], etc, to help me play, and even more elements like an [[inventory\|inventory]], [[skill\|skill]]/[[talent trees\|talent trees]], [[missions\|missions]], [[achievements\|achievements]] and [[challenges\|challenges]] for managing my virtual journeys and characters.

so i was extremely confused:

- why on earth are the tools i have to play a fictional game much better than the tools i have to manage my own real life?

***wtf is going on here?***

besides this lack of tools, there's an experience you might relate to even if you never played games. the feeling of an utterless lack of meaning, fun and fulfillment as you grow up and face the "real world" - the job market, relationships, or modern life in general.

much like many games, i started noticing that playing our well-established societal games is often times numbing. instead of inspiring us, helping us learn and evolve, they often disconnect us from ourselves, others and reality itself, making us fall prey to our own automatic, unconscious detrimental behaviors.

not only fun, the "normal adult life" lacked a soul. and i was on a mission to understand why.

this investigation brought me many more questions, such as:

- what games do i actually want to play in my life?
- why isn't life more like a game? or, why isn't there a game of life yet?
- in what ways is life already a game?
- if this game of life existed, what would it really look like? or what would it take for it to be built?
- what perspectives and instances of the "life game" are there?
- how are people already playing life? and how could we be playing it?
- how might we play life in ways that are more conscious, impactful, collaborative, fun and fulfilling? are these even good, useful perspectives to measure and orient our life towards?

throughout the past 8 years, these inquiries led me down many paths of discovery and self-transformation. the answers are much more complex, while at the same time, they can be simple. one of the big challenges is to actually make sense of so much divergent information, experiences and perspectives.

this collection of essays is my attempt to consolidate the results of this research and provide some possible directions to these and other important questions, such as:

> how can we create more fulfilling and meaningful lives in our present day and age?

this inquiry led me to the realization of our interdependence with nature and many other beings, as well as our interconnectedness with/through our human-built systems.

> how can we recognize ourselves and our role in the whole of reality and this world?

and finally,

> how can we address the spiritual/psychological, ecological, economic, political and educational crises we're going through?

below i present my thoughts and discoveries, by sharing several key concepts, challenges, references, projects and prototypes i found or created, in a comprehensive way.

### additional information

#### where am i? / what is this page?

"a digital garden is something inbetween a personal blog and a wiki. it's a collection of evolving notes, essays, and ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date. they're inherently exploratory – posts are linked through contextual associations (bi-directional links). they aren't refined or complete - posts can be published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. they're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal "blogs" we're used to encountering on the web."

if you want to know more, you can check out maggie appleton's amazing content for [a brief history & ethos of the digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) and [an extensive list of digital gardening tools and gardeners](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners).

the digital garden metaphor can go a really long way. understanding your knowledge as a web of relationships a digital garden can also be seen as part of someone's [[second brain\|second brain]], or a layer beyond it, a "[[areas/personal spaces/outer spaces/third brain\|third brain]]", so to say.

the structure i use for this garden is very simple. there are [[_000_MOCs/025 🔷 long game/025 🗺 references & topics MOC\|topics]] and [[growth stages\|growth stages]].

keep in mind, the notes i tend to and share here are primarily my personal wiki. they're meant for personal use first. most notes will be unfinished, poorly formatted and not polished, but they're still relevant/interesting enough that i choose to share them. :)

if you want to see my more refined content, you can check my [newsletter](https://c4ss1us.substack.com/), [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/c4ss1us.l1f3/), [twitter](https://twitter.com/c4ss1usl1f3) (now X), and [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@c4ss1usl1f3). this is a behind-the-curtain view into my world and second brain. 😉

#### how do I make my own garden?

i edit this using obsidian, a note-taking software that I use for my [second brain](https://maggieappleton.com/basb). you can start using the app by downloading it for free at [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md). there are many tutorials and possible advanced setups, but for starters, i recommend nick milo's ["obsidian for beginners" youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3NaIVgSlAVLHty1-NuvPa9V0b0UwbzBd) and his [LYT obsidian toolkit](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/_Start+Here).

to host my notes, i use the [obsidian digital garden plugin](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/) .

#### how can i be in the loop for new content and updates on these projects?

sign up for my [newsletter](https://c4ss1us.substack.com/). also, if you want to be even more 'in the know', one possibility is to join a whatsapp group i created, in which i only occasionally share updates and exchange with a small group of friends. i'm leaving it open for new co-conspirators as well right now, as a way to approximate our relationship if you really feel the resonance. ❤ ask me about it on [telegram](https://t.me/c4ss1us) or via email at cassius dot carv at gmail dot com.
