relevant introduction: [2R wiki - Theories of Change](https://wiki.secondrenaissance.net/wiki/Theories_of_Change)

a simple framework by [[people/friends/marcelo peterlini\|marcelo peterlini]]: [[mission\|mission]], [[vision\|vision]], [[problem\|problem]], [[worldview\|worldview]].

the [[initiatives, orgs & communities/regen/gesturing towards decolonial futures\|GTDF collective]] offers a comparison of [six different theories of change](https://decolonialfutures.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/theories-of-change-table.pdf) in terms of their understanding of the causes and solutions of global problems.

see: [[responses/design/second renaissance\|second renaissance]] papers/mapping projects for good examples.

##### what should be one's (or a society's) orientation toward change? how can we harmonize different orientations?

different perspectives include: personal and collective [[concepts/alchemy/thriving\|thriving]], the [[flourishing\|flourishing]] of all beings, [[concepts/alchemy/wisdom\|wisdom]], [[concepts/alchemy/enlightenment (spirituality)\|enlightenment]], [[liberation\|liberation]], wholistic/[[concepts/alchemy/integral development\|integral development]] and more.

while seemingly negligible, these differences in framing can make a world of difference when it comes to prioritization.

##### relevant examples:

[[people/references/architect;design/daniel schmachtenberger\|daniel schmachtenberger]]/[[initiatives, orgs & communities/design/the consilience project\|the consilience project]] advocates for omni-win-win games, [[wide boundary\|wide boundary]] metrics and [[ecosystems health\|ecosystems health]] such as described in [[development in progress\|development in progress]], [[bend not break\|bend not break]] and the [[new economic series\|new economic series]].

[[responses/alchemy/cosmoerotic humanism\|cosmoerotic humanism]] towards ever-greater [[intimacy with all things\|intimacy with all things]], achieved by the [[clarification of desire\|clarification of desire]] and [[awakening the eye of value\|awakening the eye of value]], in connection with [[eros-telos\|eros-telos]] and the [[field of value\|field of value]].

[[responses/alchemy/metamodernism\|metamodernism]] as proposed by [[people/references/alchemy/hanzi freinacht\|hanzi freinacht]] proposes an orientation towards [[concepts/alchemy/human development\|human development]]. i.e. an increase in overall [[stage\|stage]], [[code\|code]], [[state\|state]] and [[depth\|depth]].

the [[initiatives, orgs & communities/regen/gesturing towards decolonial futures\|GTDF collective]] also aligns with the [[ecosystems health\|ecosystems health]] perspective through practices of [[co-sensing with tenderness\|co-sensing with tenderness]] and developing [[sensefullness\|sensefullness]], with a focus on [[reparation\|reparation]], [[topics/design/regeneration\|regeneration]], and [[concepts/alchemy/decolonization\|decolonization]].

some other initiatives/communities, such as the [[models & frameworks/alchemy/inner development goals\|inner development goals]] or [[initiatives, orgs & communities/design/SEEDS (ecosystem)\|SEEDS]] make more agreeable/less challenging metaphysical claims and present a few easier-to-implement intermediary steps that seem to be net-positive.
