#### an introduction to this work:

the viable pathways book-zine is a *research-in-development publication* that covers a wide range of topics, exploring different [[concepts/lab/dynamic medium\|media formats]] and [[design patterns\|design patterns]] for more nuanced understanding and effective learning.

fundamentally, it's an inquiry into [[post capitalist systems\|post capitalist systems]]:

> how can we create systems that enable us to conceive [[concepts/alchemy/thriving\|thrivable]] societies, coordinating and collaborating towards more [[topics/design/regeneration\|regenerative]] and resilient presents & futures?

there is a myriad of different perspectives and research on the [[anthropocene\|anthropocene]], [[concepts/design/polycrisis\|polycrisis]] or the [[concepts/design/metacrisis\|metacrisis]]. and even where there's some agreement on the complex [[human predicament\|human predicament]] we're in, there is often divergence on what to do/how to move beyond it.

my research aimed to clarify: **what are these different perspectives, how do they converge & diverge, and could they be complementary?**

a few of my key findings were:

- systemic change requires changes in all: [[concepts/design/superstructure\|superstructure]], [[social structure\|social structure]], [[concepts/design/infrastructure\|infrastructure]] and [[physiologic structure\|physiologic structure]] - see: [[models & frameworks/design/holistic cultural materialism\|holistic cultural materialism]].

- [[communism\|communism]] & [[socialism\|socialism]] are not viable large-scale economic alternatives, since they still promote [win-lose games](https://civilizationemerging.com/new-economics-series-3/). even though we could bind [[externalities\|externalities]] at local/global levels, exponential rivalry continues, generating [[diagnosis/systemic collapse\|systemic collapse]] in the long term - see: [[diagnosis/generator functions of existential risk\|generator functions of existential risk]].

- efforts at different levels of intervention are necessary: reducing immediate systemic harm ([[horizon 1\|horizon 1]]), creating conditions for more desirable short/mid-term futures ([[horizon 2\|horizon 2]]), developing new systems altogether ([[horizon 3\|horizon 3]]) - see: [[models & frameworks/design/three horizons\|three horizons]], [[_006_core notes/theories of change\|theories of change]] & [[_006_core notes/design philosophies\|design philosophies]].

there were a plethora of references that informed these perspectives, which i'll dive into in the publication *(see: [[_007_illustrations & sketches/references map.excalidraw\|references map]] - coming soon)*, but one question persisted throughout, which is:

**amidst all of the complexity of ourselves and the world, where should i/we be most focused on?**

[[people/references/alchemy/john vervaeke\|john vervaeke]] points to this process of ongoing [[concepts/alchemy/sensemaking\|sensemaking]] and [[meaning-making\|meaning-making]] as the process of [[recursive relevance realization\|recursive relevance realization]], which starts to give us glimpses of a few answers in his [[diagnosis/meaning crisis\|awakening from the meaning crisis]] lectures.

but there are many other powerful perspectives. my attempt in this is to navigate through them and organize/reflect back in ways that are both practically orienting and challenging of deeper consideration.

a useful synthesis - though still a starting point - which i hope can support especially young people embarking on this journey of deep reflection and transformation, could be:

> although [[responses/lab/mapping\|maps]] can be very useful, there is no recipe. cultivating our own [[concepts/alchemy/wisdom\|wisdom]], nurturing our [[concepts/alchemy/dharma\|dharma]] and endeavoring to unfold our [[unique self\|unique selves]] do seem like worthy pursuits. perhaps with a lot of sincere [[topics/design/research\|research]] and decentralized [[topics/design/coordination systems\|coordination]] we can [[concepts/design/coordination layer\|clarify the nodes in the system where there's the most suffering and work to transform that]], but ultimately, it goes beyond utilitarian optimization towards mitigating suffering. there's something beyond that, often unexplainable, about what each of us feel most called to be/do/become.
> 
> one big challenge though is that often we don't even know what [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1usâ€™ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/archive/databases/experiments master list/disruptive life OS presentation v. 0.1/challenges\|challenges]] and [[possibilities\|possibilities]] exist - both [[_004_L1F3/core concepts/self-transformation\|inside of ourselves]] and [[_004_L1F3/core concepts/life design\|out there in the world]]! the [[civilizational systems\|predominant systems]] in our societies are not designed for us to have this kind of visibility and collaboration. our local efforts can be very impactful and important, but as long our society has globalized [[concepts/design/existential risk\|risks]] and [[potentials\|potentials]], coordinating across the [[superorganism\|superorganism]] to find our place(s) in the whole must become not only a possibility, but a responsibility - hopefully for increasingly more of us.
> 
> it can take several years of trial and error, research and experimentation to find the [[initiatives, orgs & communities/communities MOC\|communities]], [[terms\|terms]], [[perspectives\|perspectives]] that resonate and enrich our [[worldviews\|worldviews]]/[[ways of living\|ways of living]] - and even more time to find ways to make [[concepts/design/sacred economics\|focusing on your part of the puzzle a viable financial possibility]].
> 
> are there ways to make this journey less frustrating, isolating, tiresome and confusing?
> 
> i think so. and my first two steps were: 1) attempting to clarify what exists out there, and 2) attempting to challenge/strengthen my worldviews for coming up with a [[_004_L1F3/L1F3 support systems\|theory of change for my own expression in the world]].

so that's what this book-zine is all about: [[responses/lab/mapping\|mapping]] existing [[philosophical approaches\|approaches]]/[[_006_core notes/theories of change\|theories of change]], consolidating my [[findings\|findings]] based on cold & [[warm data\|warm data]] into a [[responses/lab/knowledge commons\|knowledge commons]] in more [[_000_digital garden/about - my approach to knowledge development\|accessible and nuanced ways]] (which helps with elucidating possible [[developmental pathways\|developmental pathways]]/[[tbprocessed/base notes/concepts - general/learning trails\|learning trails]]), and attempting to [[concepts/alchemy/sensemaking\|make sense]] of the [[concepts/design/complexity\|complexity]] going on - clarifying important [[low-hanging fruits\|low-hanging fruits]], [[leverage points\|leverage points]] & [[leverage points\|critical points of intervention]].

the compilation you will find below - the viable pathways book-zine - is still a *work in development*, but it's already partly available and being constantly updated. in it, i share in a lot more detail everything i've found. but in case you've already resonated, below i describe the status/next steps of this work and how you can contribute to it if you'd like.

#### a note on where i'm going next:

before and throughout all of this research, i've held and developed long-time intuitions about the potential of [[concepts/player/game\|games]]/[[concepts/player/serious play\|serious play]], [[collaborative life playing\|networks]] and [[inquiries & heuristics/what technology is actually worth building\|regenerative technology design]] as powerful & under-developed responses to the [[concepts/design/metacrisis\|metacrisis]].

i'll present several perspectives, references and prototypes that fundament my worldview and would love to further refine them to test/implement through the [[_004_L1F3/L1F3 support systems\|L1F3 projects]].
