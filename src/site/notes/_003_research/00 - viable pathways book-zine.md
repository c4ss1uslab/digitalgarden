hey, welcome! this is the skeleton of a living, under-construction book-zine - an experimental [[hyper-linked multimedia medium\|hyper-linked multimedia medium]] that acts as a theoretical research / practical toolkit in-between. it's still very messy, as you'll be able to see if you choose to keep reading now (or you can wait for it to be released and access the polished version later).

this book-zine is comprised of: an [[introduction\|introduction]], 5 [core essays], [α] illustrations, [x] maps, [y] excerpts, [z] core references, [Φ] deepening/clarification notes, a summary/recap and a list of [Θ] further resources...

to receive ongoing updates and/or collaborate on following publications, please [fill up this form].

#### introduction

for the past 5 years i've been devoting my life to researching what is [[human flourishing\|human flourishing]], [[how to enable it at both an individual and at a societal scale\|how to enable it at both an individual and at a societal scale]]", and "[[what's my role in it\|what's my role in it]]".

despite the boldness of the task and my humbleness to state that i don't have definitive answers, i’m happy to share what i discovered from it. since then, i've gained hints of profound clarity on some *partial, yet useful answers*, as well as on the [[_001_MOCs/025 🔷 long game/030 ⛰ challenges & framing MOC\|challenges]] and [[_001_MOCs/025 🔷 long game/035 🔭 missions MOC\|missions]] i decided to work towards. (might we collaborate on some of them? 🙃)

this is my compilation of the findings, resources and references i found most valuable on this journey. it's also part of my effort of designing and living my life as an [[experiments/made by me/player/open-source human experiment\|open-source human]] - this content intends to establish the foundational knowledge commons for the [[tbprocessed/base notes/ventures - proprietary/reality disruption labs\|reality disruption labs]] - a public [[_004_L1F3/core concepts/life intelligence\|life intelligence]] collaboratory and [[responses/design/metamodern guild\|metamodern guild]] for [L1F3 players](https://c4ss1us.notion.site/l1f3-players-unite-67b9592280554dc98a7e71918c1204c0) i've been co-creating.

you can explore this research on [different levels], based on your [background] experience as well.

if you're well-familiarized with most themes below, jump in to your desired layer.

let's dive in!

#### disclaimer - what’s my intention with these articles?

my goal in this series of articles isn’t to pose complete arguments and conclusions. it’s to share my incomplete yet reasonably well-developed research and thoughts on these topics.

a big challenge/opportunity latent in the space of sensemaking and collective intelligence is to (graphically) visualize our own perspectives, our sources of information and who we proxy our sensemaking to.

a few good examples are:

[[initiatives, orgs & communities/architect;design/the society library\|the society library]] / [[initiatives, orgs & communities/architect;design/ideamarket\|ideamarket]] / [[projects & tools/tools/design/manifold\|manifold]] / [[projects & tools/tools/design/metaculus\|metaculus]] / [[projects & tools/tools/lab/open knowledge maps\|open knowledge maps]] / [[references/lab/mapsmap hackathon\|mapsmap hackathon]] / [[initiatives, orgs & communities/architect;design/the consilience project\|the consilience project]] / [[kialo\|kialo]] / [[initiatives, orgs & communities/architect;design/goodly labs\|goodly labs]]

this is very close to what i refer to as the “what” of a “life intelligence agency”.

[[infranodus\|infranodus]], [[initiatives, orgs & communities/architect;design/golden\|golden]], [[projects & tools/tools/design/melon\|melon]]…

yet, there is still a lot more friction to doing that than to the (apparent) benefit it provides. most people have a lot of certainty over their belief system, even though statistically, it makes no sense for them to be.

my goal is to get to this stage of building “wise knowledge commons” (somewhat similar to what _[[tbprocessed/base notes/ventures - general/the stoa\|the stoa]]_ aims to do) but for now let’s work with what we have and trace viable paths to get there.

#### foundational concepts

the two major concepts that underpin this research and can help us orient ourselves on this path are: the [[concepts/design/metacrisis\|metacrisis]] and the "[[well-lived life\|well-lived life]]".

these terms are basically introducing perspectives to the questions, respectively: *where are we now, in the history of civilization?* and *what should/can we do with it?*

```ad-warning
title: important
collapse:
if you're new to these concepts or simply not very familiar with them, i strongly suggest taking the time to explore the links and references throughout the research. if you take the time with it, it will give you much more depth, nuance and recognition of the territory moving forward, so i highly encourage you to do so.
```

 i will introduce and present a few [[perspectives\|perspectives]] and [[investigation trails\|investigation trails]] on both concepts, as a way to contextualize the contents that will come afterwards and give you a few directions for further exploration.

##### 1) the [[concepts/design/metacrisis\|metacrisis]].

or also - *the systemically challenging state of our world, systems and selves*.

we're living an age of the [[concepts/design/metacrisis\|metacrisis]].

i.e. our civilization is currently on a path of increasingly exponential [[terms/catastrophic risk\|catastrophic]] and [[concepts/design/existential risk\|existential risks]], heading into ever-accelerating collapse, as it's built upon an economic system that predates on its own ecological substrate, based on large-scale game-theoretical win-lose/self-terminating dynamics and extractivist paradigms, accelerated by mainstream culture/philosophies devoid of spirit and exponential technologies further promoting these dynamics.

some folks see this as a "too dark" or gloomy perspective, prefer to talk about the "[[green transition\|green transition]]", "[[regenerative transition\|regenerative transition]]", "[[responses/design/second renaissance\|second renaissance]]", many others - and i also use these terms at times, but while *only talking about them* may be comforting, what the data shows is that our efforts are currently not even close to steer our civilization towards these brighter futures.

our institutions and systems are failing in recognizing and addressing this - [[governments\|governments]], [[initiatives, orgs & communities/organizations MOC\|organizations]], [[academia\|academia]], [[religions\|religions]], and whether [[topics/architect;design/local communities\|local]], [[decentralized communities\|decentralized]] or [[online communities\|online communities]]. this research aims to a) map the challenges we're facing, b) identify the approaches being tested, and c) under-the-radar approaches and the initiatives working to address them - as way to give us a deeper and wider understanding of our context.

there are many resources and perspectives to help you dive into this field of research, and although 'the [[concepts/design/metacrisis\|metacrisis]]' is not a sexy/enticing term (people might feel a lot more moved by terms such as [[flourishing\|flourishing]], [[love\|love]], [[beauty\|beauty]], [[topics/architect;design/regeneration\|regeneration]], [[concepts/alchemy/thriving\|thriving]]), it's in deeply understanding the complexity and challenges that we're in that we can gain awareness over it and further empower ourselves to build the [[more beautiful world our hearts know is possible\|more beautiful world our hearts know is possible]].

if you're not familiar with the concept of the [[concepts/design/metacrisis\|metacrisis]], it's a term coined by a certain corner of the internet, sometimes called the "[[sensemaking web\|sensemaking web]]", "[[liminal web\|liminal web]]" or "[[tbprocessed/base notes/concepts - general/game b\|game b]]", heavily informed by the studies of [[topics/alchemy/spiritual lineages\|wisdom traditions]], [[transpersonal psychology\|transpersonal psychology]], [[models & frameworks/alchemy/integral theory\|integral theory]], [[responses/alchemy/metamodernism\|metamodernism]], [[topics/player/game theory\|game theory]], [[cognitive science\|cognitive science]], [[topics/architect;design/systems\|systems]]/[[complexity science\|complexity science]] and a few other fields.

other adjacent terms and communities you might be familiar with are: the [[concepts/design/polycrisis\|polycrisis]], the [[regenerative movement\|regenerative movement]], the [[human potential movement\|human potential movement]], [[effective altruism\|effective altruism]], [[mindfulness\|mindfulness]], the [[humane tech\|humane tech]] movement, the [[topics/player/alternative education\|alternative education]] movement, [[effective accelerationism\|effective accelerationism]], [[topics/architect;design/web3\|web3]]...

for a deeper recognition of these adjacent groups, check out the [memetic tribes of the metacrisis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxHwkb35MkQ) video.

it's through this study that i found the most profoundly meaningful and cohesive analyses of our current situation, both as individuals and as a society at our time and age.

[[people/references/architect;design/daniel schmachtenberger\|daniel schmachtenberger]] has been a primary spokesperson about it, and i highly, highly, highly recommend his videos - check out my [curated playlist here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj8H7uBaUwDvd18QrEPugPMD5Z6Y0W-vB).

besides daniel's work, the simplest, yet most clarifying perspectives i found came from [[zak stein\|zak stein]] and the [[transformative education alliance\|transformative education alliance]] on their essay "[education is the metacrisis](https://systems-souls-society.com/education-is-the-metacrisis/)".

for further breakdowns, [[jonathan rowson\|jonathan rowson]] did an amazing deep dive into multiple perspectives an essay called [tasting the pickle: ten flavours of meta-crisis and the appetite for a new civilisation](https://systems-souls-society.com/tasting-the-pickle-ten-flavours-of-meta-crisis-and-the-appetite-for-a-new-civilisation/), [[people/references/alchemy/john vervaeke\|john vervaeke]] also has a great 50-lecture series on [[diagnosis/meaning crisis\|awakening from the meaning crisis]], [[josh field\|josh field]] shares very unique perspectives on the [[concepts/design/flow crisis\|flow crisis]], and there's a lot more you can discover by browsing the [metacrisis.org](https://metacrisis.org/) website or looking at very disruptive metacrisis-informed projects such as [[initiatives, orgs & communities/architect;design/SEEDS (ecosystem)\|SEEDS (ecosystem)]] and [[initiatives, orgs & communities/lab/holochain\|holochain]] (both are deep in the web3 space, i don't recommend if you're a beginner - understanding each of them may take dozens to hundreds of hours).

the major value i found in attempting to assess and conceptualize our current state - both as individuals and a society - is to recognize and develop vocabulary over the complex systems dynamics that are constantly affecting us, so we can be more aware of them, make better sense of what's going on and coordinate towards more desirable presents and futures.

after all, there's wisdom in the saying:


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



"a problem well-stated is half solved". 

</div></div>


([[writings/a disclaimer on the framing as a problem\|a disclaimer on the framing as a problem]])

one peculiarity about my research is that since ["unhealthy individuals create unhealthy systems and institutions"], i aim to highlight solutions and initiatives at both the individual and systems level - which isn't common. most people/institutions are concerned with either "personal" or "societal" challenges.

this awareness can give us both a sense of overwhelm and a golden possibility to redesign the foundational systems of our lives and civilizations to be more conscious, collaborative, regenerative, compassionate [insert another value you care about here] by design. perhaps even at the same time!

and it's our calling to take up [[radical responsibility\|radical responsibility]] and become [[_002_toolkit/classes/alchemist\|alchemists]], [[_002_toolkit/classes/architect\|architects]], [[_002_toolkit/classes/artist\|artists]], [[_002_toolkit/classes/builder\|builders]] and [[players\|players]] of our own realities.

##### 2) "[[the well-lived life\|the well-lived life]]".

or also - *how to design our selves, systems and lives*.

the age-old question of how to live. what is a [[good life\|good life]], a [[moral\|moral]] life or a [[life well-lived\|life well-lived]]? these are all [[ethical\|ethical]], [[metaphysical\|metaphysical]] and [[epistemological\|epistemological]] questions.

this is a non-exhaustive list, as i know there are many other paths i haven't delved into, with different degrees of scientific/philosophical foundation, but it's not my intention to provide a full map/picture here and now. that'd ideally be something many people are engaged in building, as part of a [[modular\|modular]], [[open-source\|open-source]] [[_004_L1F3/l1f3 operating system\|l1f3 operating system]], built precisely to test and coordinate propositions such as that [[inquiries & heuristics/heuristics/every perspective is partial\|every perspective is partial]] at scale.

by creating a decentralized aggregator of [[worldviews\|worldviews]] and [[practices\|practices]], we can democratize access to and support even more the practice of [[science\|science]], [[_006_core notes/design philosophies\|design philosophies]], [[topics/alchemy/spirituality\|spirituality]] and ultimately, [[concepts/alchemy/wisdom\|wisdom]].


popularity isn't necessarily a good filter.
"truth" (or scientific rigor) might also not help much. (limits/challenges of science -> not neutral observer [lifestyles, unmeasured cultural/behavioral aspects that influence results], bias for average [study what happen/may happen under most circumstances, not extraordinary/aspirational ones], etc...)

a mix of these can start to build a reasonable algorithm --> mapping claims, divergences vs. convergences of perspectives/practices, scientific findings but also subjective experience (reports from friends/network/people you trust)...

#### where do we head now?

ok, so there's a wealth of perspectives on both the [[concepts/design/metacrisis\|metacrisis]] we're undergoing as a species/civilization, as well as the concept of a [[well-lived life\|well-lived life]], considering our capacity for [[human flourishing\|human flourishing]] and different perspectives on [[how to live\|how to live]].

if we can agree on a few [[assumptions\|assumptions]], such as that [[inquiries & heuristics/heuristics/every perspective is partial\|every perspective is partial]], we can start to build a set of [[heuristics\|heuristics]] to inform our [[topics/alchemy/sensemaking\|sensemaking]] and [[terms/decision-making\|decision-making]] going forward.

there is a route of recognizing/honoring the herculean effort that some synthesizers/expert generalists were able to do on a "[[concepts/alchemy/theory of everything\|theory of everything]]", such as [[an immanent metaphysics\|an immanent metaphysics]], [[models & frameworks/alchemy/unified theory of knowledge\|unified theory of knowledge]], [[models & frameworks/alchemy/integral theory\|integral theory]], and [[references/alchemy/first principles and first values\|first principles and first values]] - that even though truly amazing and necessary, are very inaccessible for the vast majority of people right now.

also, acknowledging my lack of knowledge/expertise in multiple areas and my personal position as a young person trying to make sense of the world, i'll opt for taking the bits of wisdom i found from here and there and ask - *is there a minimum and easiest set of agreements that many people, holding different values and worldviews, can agree on? and if so, how might we work from there?*

this is my attempt to answer the question: what is the [[minimum set of agreements that we need in order to enable intelligent coordination\|minimum set of agreements that we need in order to enable intelligent coordination]]?

and with that, we will dive deeper into the questions/inquiries below:

1) [[concepts/alchemy/consciousness\|consciousness]] / [[topics/regen/earth regeneration\|regeneration]]
- what is human flourishing / thriving / unfoldment and how do we enable it?
- how can we, in spite of our relative ignorance/impotence, still be regenerative actors in the world?
(i.e. given our different progress across values, consciousness, and other lines of intelligence, how can we still coordinate towards resilience & regeneration?)

2) [[topics/architect;design/systems\|systems]] / [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss1us.design\|design]]
- how can we design and implement omni-win, antifragile, agent-centric systems & tools for self-development, sensemaking, connection, coordination, collaboration and play at the basis of our civilizations?
- how can we enable minimally viable vocational / regenerative / sacred economies & lifestyles?

3) [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss.art\|art]] / [[topics/player/play\|play]]
- how can art, story, community, play & metagames support our integral development and help us address the metacrisis?

4) [[topics/architect;design/technology\|technology]] / [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss1us.lab\|lab]]
- how should and how can technology support our integral development and help us address the metacrisis?

##### why choose this "minimum viable" route?

below, under "go deeper", you can find all of the metaphysical, ontological and epistemological basis that i found through this research, and that currently compose my set of "minimum viable heuristics" for operating in life.

but it's not about that. this is an ongoing effort we all do in life, questioning, making sense of reality and clashing our perspectives against others. i'm not presenting this to be "right" or to seem "wise".

a long-term mission of this work is to create an interoperability protocol for sensemaking and coordination at different levels.

##### benefits & challenges of taking this route

accessibility. more people, more awareness, more action, faster transformation.

different from being stranded at the sea, it's like swimming in a shallow pool. you can swim as much as you want, but if you need, you can just pause, place your feet on the ground and have some rest!

so if anything feels dissonant/unclear, i encourage you to pause and [dive deeper].

challenges: it's not enough. yet, compared to our baseline levels of happiness, health, wealth, it's a significant improvement.

other big challenges with working with loosely defined philosophical foundations are succumbing to [[relativism\|relativism]] / [[urgency bias\|urgency bias]] as seen in many post-modern, left-leaning initiatives, or widespread [[utilitarianism\|utilitarianism]] / [[superiority bias\|superiority bias]] as seen in many [[effective altruism\|effective altruism]] / [[effective accelerationism\|effective accelerationism]] communities.

##### low hanging-fruit agreements

i believe these are easy to agree on and they can lead to a powerful level of clarity and collaboration.
