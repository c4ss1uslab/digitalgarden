a therapeutic/coaching practice/methodology of "[[unfoldment\|unfoldment]]" proposed by [[steve march\|steve march]], integrating wisdom from multiple [[concepts/psychospiritual tools & practices\|psychospiritual tools & practices]] into an [[ecology of practices\|ecology of practices]]. it feels really resonant and i want to learn/experience more of it in the coming months.

###### a few scrappy/unprocessed notes from this podcast:

4 generations of coaching:
1) outer
2) inner (still adjusting)
3) structure -> process (experiential, in the moment, relational)

aletheia distinction: depth + improving to unfoldment
deepen self-contact. what's present.

setbacks, deficient place. nothing missing, whole. what's here?

spontaneous deepening & unfolding -> IFS + depth ontology

heidegger:

technological x poetic attunement
improvement -> unfoldment

what we orient ourselves toward: capacity standing in reserve x (true, good, beautiful)

obsoleted, broken, optimized -> machine language

what's here? different depths:
1) parts (surface) - separation
2) process - fluid flow, felt experience, transient, impermanence (portal)
3) presence/absence 
4) non-duality

not control.
