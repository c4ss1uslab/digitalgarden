#### about

one of my major - despite still recent (2024) - [[topics/architect;design/research\|research]] topics and a direction i want to head way more into in the future. understanding/designing [[topics/architect;design/technology\|technology]] according to [[topics/architect;design/regeneration\|regenerative]] principles - especially and more specifically, [[topics/lab/computing\|computing]] in a [[topics/architect;design/civilizational collapse\|post-collapse]] world.

a fantastic very short introduction to the subject: https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/permacomputing.html

a deeper introduction coming from more of a [[topics/lab/computer science\|computer science]] background: https://100r.co/site/computing_and_sustainability.html

the definitive wiki: https://permacomputing.net/

#### context

it can be a hard pill to swallow. for me, it partly was. first because it required many other pills before - the disillusionment with the [[terms/techno-optimism\|techno-optimism]] / [[effective accelerationism\|effective accelerationist]] meme, the understanding of [[tbprocessed/base notes/topics/permaculture\|permaculture]]/the [[topics/architect;design/regeneration\|regenerative]] meme, the overall opening of the heart and the [[eye of value\|eye of value]] - plus, seeing the attempts at [[tech for good\|tech for good]], [[models & frameworks/human-centered design\|human-centered design]] as often times, not going deep enough.

secondly, especially emotionally for me, as someone who grew up watching [[references/player/anime ; manga ; webtoon/sword art online\|sword art online]], and to this day still loves [[references/player/anime ; manga ; webtoon/overgeared\|overgeared]], [[references/player/anime ; manga ; webtoon/solo leveling\|solo leveling]] and some other highly advanced tech-gaming real-life scenarios, to have one of the **core tenets of technology design** for it be **[[self-obviating\|self-obviating]]** is at first, heartbreaking.

learning to connect more deeply with our own nature/history - with our long list of [[ancestral technologies\|ancestral]], [[social technologies\|social]], [[terms/analog technologies\|analog]], [[digital technologies\|digital]] and [[concepts/psychotechnologies\|psychotechnologies]] - and how to live without a reliance on so much of the technology we've built, is a lifelong journey.

after dealing with all of the emotions that come with this, then we can go back to exploring exciting propositions/lines of research, such as [[people/references/lab/bret victor\|bret victor]]'s on [[media for thinking the unthinkable\|media for thinking the unthinkable]], and to the roots of [[topics/lab/cybernetics\|cybernetics]] and [[topics/lab/computer science\|computer science]] as a whole, asking - how might we, if possible, use the computational medium to support life on earth? - and other related questions, considering the [[ethics\|ethics]], [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss1us.design\|design]] and [manufacturing process] of it all from a much more conscious standpoint.
