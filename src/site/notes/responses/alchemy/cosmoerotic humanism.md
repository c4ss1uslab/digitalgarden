cosmoerotic humanism is a post-postmodern philosophical project that aims to expand our understanding of [[topics/alchemy/metaphysics\|metaphysics]], [[concepts/design/value\|value]] and the [[sacred\|sacred]], integrating insights from different fields ([[perennial philosophy\|perennial philosophy]], [[topics/alchemy/spiritual lineages\|wisdom traditions]], different [[concepts/alchemy/interior sciences\|interior]] and [[terms/sciences\|exterior sciences]]) into a coherent [[story of value\|story of value]] - and therefore, of [[ethics\|ethics]], [[love\|love]] and [[evolution\|evolution]] - both deep and broad enough to be able to respond adequately to the [[concepts/design/metacrisis\|metacrisis]] - i.e. the unique set of [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1us‚Äô notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/archive/databases/experiments master list/disruptive life OS presentation v. 0.1/challenges\|challenges]] and [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1us‚Äô notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/archive/1 - on hold-waiting for/Porter's Generic Strategies - Choosing Your Route to Success/Untitled/Opportunities\|opportunities]] we're facing in our (also unique) moment in the history of human civilizations.

##### alternative video introduction

[Cosmo-Erotic Humanism: First Principles and Values w/ Zak Stein and Marc Gafni(https://www.youtube.com/@thestoa)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MZ7X6cBPnM)

```ad-seealso

16:11 "we have the metacrisis. the metacrisis is driven by existential risk. existential risk is driven by exponentialized technologies being weaponized. that itself is driven by win-lose metrics/rivalrous conflict, that generates the races to the bottom, the tragedies of the commons, [[multipolar traps]] - everyone has to develop that weapon system, but there's no interior technology to respond to it" (...) "at the core of the metacrisis is what? a breakdown in a shared story of value (that could actually generate a response to the metacrisis)."

we can't cohere/resonate unless we have the same story of value. it's the story of value that generates the possibility of coherence.

"pre-tragic / tragic / post-tragic consciousness"

"the interior of interconnectivity (systems complexity) is intimacy"

"mytho-poetic moves vs ontological moves"
```

#### notes from podcasts:

##### conversations with david j. temple
###### value is the cure:

intrinsic vs instrumental
hypothetical & categorical-imperative (absolute)
donor & receiver (exchange value vs use value in marxism)
end & aims?
goods-first (pleasure) & values-first (pleasure is a value, the more value you have, the more valuable it is)

theories of value -> dismissed

deontological and deological

one points toward the other.

##### zak's appearances as a guest
###### zak & daniel on recentering value in education

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtCFfEGjfW0

separation of church & state:

school isn't attempting to answer "what is the good life?" -> family/religion/civil society.

school is preparing you to be a citizen/consumer/worker.

"no phones, minimal screen time" -> tech as addicting/distracting vs tech as augmenting/enhancing.

environmental education was supposed to turn us into "mindful consumers", but it didn't. it just made us feel guilty about it.

##### loose notes in portuguese about the value of introducing cosmoerotic humanism in a brazilian context

convite: meta-an√°lise das filosofias, religi√µes, tradi√ß√µes de vis√µes do sagrado e da evolu√ß√£o, mas de um lugar participat√≥rio movimentos surgindo & desenvolver linguagem comum que possibilita com profundidade, rigor e amorosidade pra falar sobre espiritualidade, sagrado, consci√™ncia, significado. espiritualidade pode virar intelig√™ncia. vira algo que vc pode entender como desenvolver como resposta √† metacrise.

encontro com o sagrado, trazer pro lado. espiritualidade/sagrado tem valor. e there's a danger, mas melhor e abrir caminho pra ir a fundo em grandes tradi√ß√µes e new cosmological visions.

como essa intelig√™ncia espiritual se revela. a partir da clarification of desire -> open the eye of value. quanto mais t√° aberto, mais a sua spiritual intelligence t√° refined. ok, so how do we clarify desire? how do we open eye of value?

pedagogical:
[eye of value] + [strategic]
