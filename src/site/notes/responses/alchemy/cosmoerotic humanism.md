cosmoerotic humanism is a post-postmodern philosophical project that aims to expand our understanding of [[topics/alchemy/metaphysics\|metaphysics]], [[concepts/design/value\|value]] and the [[sacred\|sacred]], integrating insights from different fields ([[perennial philosophy\|perennial philosophy]], [[topics/alchemy/spiritual lineages\|wisdom traditions]], different [[concepts/alchemy/interior sciences\|interior]] and [[terms/sciences\|exterior sciences]]) into a coherent [[story of value\|story of value]] - and therefore, of [[ethics\|ethics]], [[love\|love]] and [[evolution\|evolution]] - both deep and broad enough to be able to respond adequately to the [[concepts/design/metacrisis\|metacrisis]] - i.e. the unique set of [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1usâ€™ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/archive/databases/experiments master list/disruptive life OS presentation v. 0.1/challenges\|challenges]] and [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1usâ€™ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/archive/1 - on hold-waiting for/Porter's Generic Strategies - Choosing Your Route to Success/Untitled/Opportunities\|opportunities]] we're facing in our (also unique) moment in the history of human civilizations.

**alternative:** a good intro in video format - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MZ7X6cBPnM

my highlights from this video:

16:11 "we have the metacrisis. the metacrisis is driven by existential risk. existential risk is driven by exponentialized technologies being weaponized. that itself is driven by win-lose metrics/rivalrous conflict, that generates the races to the bottom, the tragedies of the commons, [[concepts/design/multipolar traps\|multipolar traps]] - everyone has to develop that weapon system, but there's no interior technology to respond to it" (...) "at the core of the metacrisis is what? a breakdown in a shared story of value (that could actually generate a response to the metacrisis)."

we can't cohere/resonate unless we have the same story of value. it's the story of value that generates the possibility of coherence.

"pre-tragic / tragic / post-tragic consciousness"

"the interior of interconnectivity (systems complexity) is intimacy"

"mytho-poetic moves vs ontological moves"
