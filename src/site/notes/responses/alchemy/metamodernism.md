the metamodern meme sees most of the challenges in the world as a [[topics/alchemy/developmental psychology\|developmental]] challenge.

people's [[psychological development\|psychological development]] should be taken way more seriously. we live in a [laggard world](https://diome.xyz/2+%F0%9F%8C%BF+Leaves/Civilizational+Layers+%26+Cycles), in which our institutions aren't prepared at all to deal with the large-scale [[complicated systems\|complicated systems]] we've built and the [[concepts/design/metacrisis\|metacrisis]] as a whole (which [[people/references/alchemy/hanzi freinacht\|hanzi]] refers to as the "multi-faceted" crisis).

on their [[_009_notes & highlights from books, videos, articles/listening society\|listening society]] book, hanzi proposes a fantastic definition of [[concepts/alchemy/human development\|human development]] consisting of: [[stage\|stage]], [[code\|code]], [[state\|state]] and [[depth\|depth]] and proposes a few [[responses/alchemy/metamodernism#^64055d\|enlightening perspectives]] and [[policy suggestions\|policy suggestions]] based on their [[sociological analysis\|sociological analysis]].

i.e. in summary, it states:

why "psychological development matters" and shows how it's the basis for the development of other areas of society ([[education\|education]], [[topics/design/politics\|politics]], etc).

as a society, we have major:

- developmental blindness
- inner dimensions blindness

and we can conceptualize [[concepts/alchemy/human development\|human development]] as consisting of: [[stage\|stage]] (cognitive development) ([[smarts\|smarts]]), [[code\|code]] (symbolic development) ([[topics/player/learning\|learning]]), [[state\|state]] ([[well-being\|well-being]]), [[depth\|depth]] ([[concepts/alchemy/wisdom\|wisdom]]).

###### what do they say about the metacrisis?

i'm not sure if i agree with their super long-term perspective, i'm generally more inclined towards the need for a [[concepts/alchemy/humanity's phase shift\|phase shift]].
