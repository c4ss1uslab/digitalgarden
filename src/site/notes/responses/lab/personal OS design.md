#### foundational inquiries

what are the core elements of a [[topics/design/regeneration\|regenerative]], [[models & frameworks/design/humane design\|humane]], [[concepts/design/agent-centric design\|agent-centric]] [[operating system\|operating system]]? how is it different from the [[operating systems\|operating systems]] we have today? how may it change when we consider the design of an [[OS of the future\|OS of the future]]?

\+ what can we do with our existing [[operating systems\|operating systems]] to make them more [[humane\|humane]], [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1usâ€™ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/archive/databases/professional quadrants/intentional\|intentional]], [[topics/design/regeneration\|regenerative]] for now?

there are a few projects that offer interesting possibilities...
