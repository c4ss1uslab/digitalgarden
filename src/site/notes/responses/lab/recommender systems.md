##### related projects:

i've always wondered how there aren't self-hosted recommender systems trained on your [[RSS\|RSS]] subscriptions, people you follow in social media, [[terms/articles\|articles]]/[[videos\|videos]] you consume, etc.

i've been wanting to train models/host my own algorithms for many years, but still haven't made much progress on the development side, besides the designs i've been exploring with the [[prototypes & designs/made by me/omnichannel curation feed\|omnichannel curation feed]] experiment.

it feels like such a massive strategic/leverage point, not just having the right recommendations being delivered to you (going beyond persona-based filtering, more towards matching content type/level with what you're looking for), but even the act of ever-more training and engaging with your recommender system to clarify and uncover what your knowledge gaps are and what you're really looking for.

a few emerging projects are obviously using [[topics/lab/large language models\|LLMs]] to be start moving in this direction, but even in spite of the [[resource\|resource]]/[[energy\|energy]] constraints on that, i'm still very unsure about how much LLM-centric this architecture should be. end-user training on [[taste\|taste]] and [[patterns/pattern collections/knowledge design patterns\|knowledge design patterns]] seem much more promising directions. (see: [[people/references/architect;design/sari azout\|sari azout]]/[[initiatives, orgs & communities/design/sublime (ex-startupy)\|sublime]]'s content for lots of examples/discussion on that)

for a few years i've been following the developments of a few projects in this space, to see how/when they can facilitate that:
