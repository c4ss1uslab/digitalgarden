música do círculo (MdC) is a practice created by 3 brazilian artists-educators-facilitators who later on founded an institute by the same name. it's a collective practice of improvised music-making and human connection, without the use of any instruments (i.e. body music) and for people of all levels of experience. it works by integrating 8 major elements, being them: [[improvisation\|improvisation]], [[concepts/player/game\|games]], [[non-verbal communication\|non-verbal communication]], the [[circle\|circle]], [[body music\|body music]], [[contact\|contact]], [[movement\|movement]] and [[concepts/alchemy/flow\|flow]].

the facilitators (also called conductors) propose several games throughout the practice exploring these different elements in different ways each time, while also encouraging and creating a safe space for the creative expression, experimentation and proposition by the group itself.

it's a crazy psycho-spiritual, physical, musical and relational practice that i discovered in june 2023 and since then have been to a retreat (7 days doing this 6h+ a day), 50+ sessions with a smaller group in [[são paulo\|são paulo]] and i intend to do the 2-year-long facilitator training starting on august 2024.

the field of deep listening it creates help us very quickly tap into the [[collective intelligence\|collective intelligence]] of the group, facilitating the [[emergence\|emergence]] of whatever is alive in each of us and connecting us with deeper layers of our [[musical intelligence\|musical intelligence]] and [[self-expression\|self-expression]]. the barrier for entry is super low, you really don't have to "be an artist", "know how to sing", or any of that. you just need to be willing to play.

the founders are also deep thinkers - informed by references such as [[people/references/architect;design/charles eisenstein\|charles eisenstein]]'s work, [[concepts/alchemy/decolonization\|decolonial theory and practices]], and [[models & frameworks/host/pedagogia da cooperação\|cooperation pedagogy]] - and very inclusive [[artists\|artists]], always exploring fun and unconventional ways of learning/creating together.

the 3 major references that inspired the development of the practice are: [[barbatuques\|barbatuques]] ([[fernando barba\|fernando barba]]/[[stênio mendes\|stênio mendes]]' [[body percussion\|body percussion]]/[[improvisation\|improvisation]] [[games\|games]]), [[bobby mcferrin\|bobby mcferrin]] ([[circlesongs\|circlesongs]], [[vocal improvisation\|vocal improvisation]]) and [[models & frameworks/host/pedagogia da cooperação\|pedagogia da cooperação]].

the sessions are usually 1h30-long, and though there's some content posted online the experience of watching them (or even understanding what the practice is, as i just described) vs participating is completely different. i highly recommend you join one session to experience its magic before watching it/researching too much about it. they happen once a month in são paulo (brazil), or in some workshops they host/participate in, in europe, and north/latin america.

it seems to me that it's easier to experience the [[concepts/alchemy/flow\|flow]]/[[magic\|magic]] it creates that way. later on we can learn about the alchemical rules and procedures guiding it. :)

if you're curious anyway, below are a few recordings i liked:

\+ they also have a really cool card deck which condenses the methodology, breaking it down into 8 games, 8 elements and 8 spatial formations (that people go deeper into during the 2-year-long leading training):

> [!seealso]- other somewhat poetic thoughts/reflections:
> 
> mdc is a post-tragic practice, in the sense of owning our traumas - recognizing the first and second [[shocks of existence\|shocks of existence]] and practicing going beyond the stages of pre-tragic, tragic and post-tragic awareness.
> 
> it's also a relational practice - being aware of our conscious and unconscious selves and the unfoldment of our patterns, actions and ways of being - how they live in us and how what we share inflict upon/affect others.
> 
> as a practice, it seems to have a particular quality reminiscing sense of lost innocence but reclaimed playfulness. we can allow our children can just play freely, knowing they're seen, respected and supported in this space, cultivating a way of interbeing typical of post-collapse, based on community trust, vulnerability and self-expression...
