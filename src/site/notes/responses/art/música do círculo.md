música do círculo (MdC) is both a community and a practice of improvised music-making, human development and connection, without the use of any instruments (i.e. body music) and for people of all levels of musical experience. it works by integrating 8 major elements, being them: [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1us’ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/archive/databases/superskills master list/improvisation\|improvisation]], [[concepts/player/game\|games]], [[non-verbal communication\|non-verbal communication]], the [[circle\|circle]], [[topics/art/body music\|body music]], [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1us’ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/archive/databases/experiments master list/c4ss1us.l1f3 launch/personal website/website pages/contact\|contact]], [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1us’ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/archive/databases/superskills master list/movement\|movement]] and [[concepts/alchemy/flow\|flow]].

the facilitators (also called conductors) propose several games throughout the practice exploring these different elements in different ways each time, while also encouraging and creating a safe space for the creative expression, experimentation and proposition by the group itself.

it's created by 3 brazilian artists-educators-facilitators who later on founded an institute by the same name, inspired by 3 major references: [[barbatuques\|barbatuques]] ([[fernando barba\|fernando barba]]/[[stênio mendes\|stênio mendes]]' [[body percussion\|body percussion]]/[[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1us’ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/archive/databases/superskills master list/improvisation\|improvisation]] [[games\|games]]), [[bobby mcferrin\|bobby mcferrin]] ([[circlesongs\|circlesongs]], [[vocal improvisation\|vocal improvisation]]) and the [[models & frameworks/host/cooperation pedagogy\|cooperation pedagogy]].

as a practice, it's able to create an [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1us’ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/archive/databases/industries master list/education\|educational]], [[concepts/alchemy/healing\|therapeutic]] and [[_004_c4ss1us/c4ss.art\|artistic]] space at the same time. its structure and games provide supportive contexts for the creative/[[artistic expression\|artistic expression]] of the group, promotes [[models & frameworks/host/cooperation pedagogy\|cooperation]] principles, [[deep listening\|deep listening]] and [[concepts/alchemy/decolonization\|decolonial]] modes of relating, and through a radical embrace and harmonious arrangement of co-existing levels of [[concepts/alchemy/consciousness\|consciousness]], it inspires us to think about how to create this quality of field in other spaces as well.

it's a crazy psycho-spiritual, physical, musical and relational practice that i discovered in june 2023 and since then i've been to a retreat (7 days doing this 6h+ a day), done 50+ sessions with a smaller group in [[são paulo\|são paulo]] and started the 2-year-long leading training on august 2024.

the field of deep listening it creates help us very quickly tap into the [[concepts/design/collective intelligence\|collective intelligence]] of the group, facilitating the [[emergence\|emergence]] of whatever is alive in each of us and connecting us with deeper layers of our [[musical intelligence\|musical intelligence]] and [[self-expression\|self-expression]]. the barrier for entry is super low, you really don't have to "be an artist", "know how to sing", or any of that. you just need to be willing to play.

the founders are also deep thinkers - informed by references such as [[people/references/design/charles eisenstein\|charles eisenstein]]'s work, [[concepts/alchemy/decolonization\|decolonial theory and practices]], and [[models & frameworks/host/cooperation pedagogy\|cooperation pedagogy]] - and very inclusive [[artists\|artists]], always exploring fun and unconventional ways of learning/creating together.

the sessions are usually 1h30-long, and although there's some content posted online the experience of watching them (or even understanding what the practice is, as i just described) vs participating is completely different. i highly recommend you join one session to experience its magic before watching it/researching too much about it. they happen once a month in são paulo (brazil), or in some workshops they host/participate in, in europe, and north/latin america.

it seems to me that it's easier to experience the [[concepts/alchemy/flow\|flow]]/[[magic\|magic]] it creates that way. later on we can learn about the alchemical rules and procedures guiding it. :)

if you're curious anyway, below are a few recordings i liked:

\+ they also have a really cool card deck which condenses the methodology, breaking it down into 8 games, 8 elements and 8 spatial formations (that people go deeper into during the 2-year-long leading training):

> [!seealso]- other somewhat poetic thoughts/reflections:
> 
> mdc is a post-tragic practice, in the sense of owning our traumas - recognizing the first and second [[shocks of existence\|shocks of existence]] and practicing going beyond the stages of pre-tragic, tragic and post-tragic awareness.
> 
> it's also a relational practice - being aware of our conscious and unconscious selves and the unfoldment of our patterns, actions and ways of being - how they live in us and how what we share inflict upon/affect others.
> 
> as a practice, it seems to have a particular quality reminiscing sense of lost innocence but reclaimed playfulness. we can allow our children can just play freely, knowing they're seen, respected and supported in this space, cultivating a way of interbeing typical of post-collapse, based on community trust, vulnerability and self-expression...
