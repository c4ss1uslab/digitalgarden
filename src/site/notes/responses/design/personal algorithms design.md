algorithms can specify the logic/[[terms/decision-making\|decision-making]] processes you use to navigate in life, within yourself and in the world at large.

dominant social media algorithms are based on your patterns of behavior **now** (+ predictive processing) that don't necessarily (and are often opposed) to helping you become who you want to be **in the future**.

[[social curation\|social curation]] is a powerful force that underlined our developmental processes as a species throughout time. it's a good place to start. what do you like/resonate with? what do the people/organizations you like/resonate with?

#### 2 main projects:

1) clarifying *a) desirable algorithms* and *b) algorithms already embedded* in your [[_003_L1F3/core concepts/self-transformation\|self-transformation]], [[_003_L1F3/core concepts/life design\|life design]] and [[concepts/lab/personal tech stack\|personal tech stack]]
2) designing/implementing a [[responses/lab/recommender systems\|recommender systems]] for oneself
