#### about 

the "second renaissance" (a.k.a 2R) is very interesting frame proposed by [[initiatives, orgs & communities/design/life itself\|life itself]] for understanding/navigating the civilization era we're living.

https://secondrenaissance.net/

lots of good resources there, especially for introducing people into more wholistic/critical/actionable ways of thinking about our current age - its beauties, failures, challenges & potentials.

#### my reflections

(as of september, 2024):

the question that arises for me is: is a "second renaissance" possible (in our current day and age) without some "dark age" period? or will we inevitably move towards collapse?

how can we facilitate a graceful descent? and could that descent still really be a "renaissance"?

maybe yes. a material descent/complete makeover and a spiritual/regenerative renaissance?

it deeply resonates. a renaissance full of meaning, flourishing, revival, regeneration. widespread more conscious, challenging, yet nourishing lifestyles and ways of being. [[metamodern arts\|metamodern arts]], [[topics/alchemy/indigenous wisdom\|indigenous wisdom]], [[topics/design/systems science\|systems]] and [[concepts/alchemy/interior sciences\|interior sciences]] show viable ways forward. [[initiatives, orgs & communities/design/life itself\|life itself]] and my own efforts in mapping emergent initiatives/ecosystems also do.

hopefully we can support a [[critical yeast\|critical yeast]] to mature quickly and powerfully enough to facilitate this transition gracefully. (related to: [[mettatropical leadership academy\|mettatropical leadership academy]])

*why i'm somewhat worried:*

if we look at the actual hard data and the systems at the base of our modern civilizations, the major drivers of the [[concepts/design/metacrisis\|metacrisis]] are there  underlying dynamics of [[exponentialization of existential and catastrophic risks\|exponentialization of existential and catastrophic risks]] and [[topics/design/systems\|systems]]/[[behaviors\|behaviors]] that are increasingly exploitative, wealth-concentrating and [[debasing our ecological substrate\|debasing our ecological substrate]].

without any major civilizational-level changes, the trajectory we're headed towards is a collapse (and of the ugly kind), or more hopefully, as [[nate hagens\|nate hagens]] states, a [[concepts/design/the great simplification\|great simplification]].

still, we as a humanity have made major civilization shifts before. i work for/hope that we can consciously navigate it this time.

#### other perspectives:

although this framing is inspiring to me, to many, especially in the global south, the "second renaissance" may feel/seem like an [[eurocentric\|eurocentric]] term. so i'd like to also use other terms such as the [[tbprocessed/base notes/concepts - general/regenerative renaissance\|regenerative renaissance]] and [[tbprocessed/base notes/concepts - general/metamodern renaissance\|metamodern renaissance]]. but the framing of the "second renaissance" really puts into perspective our present-day in historical time and can help us more deeply question what is the nature/essence of a cultural renaissance, so i like that.

a good framing could be:

the first renaissance was an age of retrieval of lost [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1us’ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/archive/databases/project-mission category/knowledge\|knowledge]] & [[concepts/alchemy/wisdom\|wisdom]], a profound questioning that permeated the zeitgeist and produced new expressions of the [[true\|true]], [[good\|good]] and [[beautiful\|beautiful]] (e.g. science, law and art) integrating some ancient wisdom with the tools, discoveries and context of modernity.

the second renaissance is both an integration of our discoveries across multiple social, exterior and interior sciences, and also a reintegration of [[indigenous knowledge\|indigenous knowledge]], [[topics/alchemy/indigenous wisdom\|wisdom]] and [[concepts/alchemy/ways of knowing\|ways of knowing]] that were systemically persecuted and erased by modernity.

a new understanding of [[concepts/alchemy/values\|values]] and the [[sacred\|sacred]] has to underpin it.
