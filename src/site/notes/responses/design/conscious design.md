my working definition of a "conscious design" is one that recognizes the value of and integrates multiple dimensions of [[concepts/alchemy/consciousness\|consciousness]] in its approach.

see: https://unexaminedtechnology.substack.com/p/what-would-an-awakened-approach-to

[[aki jÃ¤rvinen\|aki jÃ¤rvinen]] frames it here as the design towards 3 axis: [[transcendence\|transcendence]], [[connectedness\|connectedness]] and [[immanence\|immanence]]. very much based on the work of [[gabriel fernandez-borsot\|gabriel fernandez-borsot]].

another good way of seeing it would be "wide boundary design". see: https://www.thegreatsimplification.com/frankly-original/65-and-then-what-using-wide-boundary-lenses

still lots more to be worked on/defined here.
