my working definition of a "conscious design" is one that recognizes the value of and integrates multiple dimensions of [[concepts/alchemy/consciousness\|consciousness]] in its approach.

see: https://unexaminedtechnology.substack.com/p/what-would-an-awakened-approach-to

[[aki järvinen\|aki järvinen]] frames it here as the design towards 3 axis: [[transcendence\|transcendence]], [[connectedness\|connectedness]] and [[immanence\|immanence]]. very much based on the work of [[gabriel fernandez-borsot\|gabriel fernandez-borsot]].

another good way of seeing it would be "[[responses/design/wide boundary design\|wide boundary design]]".

still lots more to be worked on/defined here.
