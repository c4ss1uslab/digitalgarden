objective: i want to gather funds as a l1f3 player, so i can keep building/playing the game.

my offerings:
- [[projects & tools/made by me/lab/reality mapping\|reality]]/[[projects & tools/made by me/lab/internet mapping\|internet maps]], written content on my reflections & learnings, self-discovery experiments
- research consolidations, navigation maps, curated lists, core insights, ideas & systems designs
- well-produced sketches/designs/prototypes, maps & videos
- practical/useful/inspiring digital tools (as part of the game)
- livestreams, community, collaborative gameplay sessions, content + references to support l1f3 playing

-> my goal with this is to develop infrastructure and an ecosystem for l1f3 players, so more can do this in a sustainable way and we can create new, more regenerative & disruptive reality models and lifestyles.

--> this is completely badass. i need to explain this more.

in order to be funded, i need to share at least one of + conceptual basis for the others:
- [[_004_L1F3/l1f3 game\|l1f3 game]] mvp
- [[_004_L1F3/l1f3 operating system\|l1f3 OS]] mvp
