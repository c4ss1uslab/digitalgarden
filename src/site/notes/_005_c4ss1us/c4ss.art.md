#### art beyond the artsy

[[tbprocessed/base notes/concepts - general/art\|art]], amongst many things, is a way to connect with our higher aspirations. it's a mirror that both reflects life and society, but also possibilities and ideals different from the present ones. it's a bridge between the possible and the actual, and it provides a way to [[terms/creation\|create]] from a deeper place of [[terms/connection\|connection]] and [[recognition\|recognition]] - of who we are, where we are, and how we might contribute to it.

not all art comes from this place, nor could it be the case due to many [[concepts/design/incentive structures\|incentive structures]], [[psychological biases\|psychological biases]] and widespread [[diagnosis/meaning crisis\|psycho-spiritual alienation]] of our times. i'd argue that's not even the goal. art doesn't have to be perfect, immaculate. if it reflects our authentic experience, however messy, confused, weird, and ugly it is, i believe it's serving its purpose.

still, a question remains:

> how can we create art that's profoundly moving, inspiring, supportive and empowering? 💫

in my experience, [[tbprocessed/base notes/concepts - general/art\|art]] is what ultimately connects us with a deeper sense of [[beauty\|beauty]] and appreciation. that's necessarily related to a recognition of [[concepts/design/value\|value]], or the [[sacred\|sacred]]. it's what often makes us want to keep on living.

i'm therefore especially interested in [[story\|stories]], [[visuals\|visuals]], [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1us’ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/archive/databases/superskills master list/movement\|movement]], [[sounds\|sounds]], [[concepts/player/game\|games]] & [[concepts/design/memetics\|memetics]] that come from or reflect this [[terms/evolutionary\|evolutionary]]/[[sacred\|sacred]] sense.

[[tbprocessed/base notes/concepts - general/art\|art]] is revolutionary as in 1) it empowers us to see ourselves as [[creators\|creators]], and act from that place - and 2) it can provide direct responses to the many [[diagnosis/intimacy crisis\|intimacy]], [[diagnosis/meaning crisis\|meaning]], and [[diagnosis/existential crisis\|existential crises]] we're going through.

what i share below are some of my key themes of [[topics/design/research\|research]], [[topics/player/learning\|learning]] and [[topics/design/curation\|curation]], that have both helped me in my journey so far and that i want to further dive into, so as to develop capacity to a) create such beauty and b) support others who might be struggling on this path.
