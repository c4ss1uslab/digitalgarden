#### a brief personal context

back when i was 15 years old (2014), i had a quasi-spiritual experience while deciding what the hell i should do with my life. i tell the full story [somewhere else], but in short, i decided that even though i was a typical nerd, loved [[topics/player/gaming\|gaming]], and had an affinity for the logic and mathematics involved in [[topics/lab/programming\|programming]], i wouldn't learn it, at least for the foreseeable future.

i realized that i wasn't interested in programming per se, but in what could be built with it. sure, games are cool, but it dawned on me that [[_004_L1F3/l1f3 game\|life is the biggest game there is]].

i would have absolutely loved to have [[references/player/anime;manga;webtoon/sword art online\|sword art online]] (or more recent versions of "[[alternate reality gaming\|alternate reality gaming]]" such as [[references/player/anime;manga;webtoon/solo leveling\|solo leveling]] or [[references/player/anime;manga;webtoon/overgeared\|overgeared]]) in real life, but i also really wanted to figure out [[core essays/🕹 prototypes, experiments & low-hanging fruits - collaborative life design, energy management, life as play\|how to play life as well as i can]]. in the most beautiful, cool, exciting, surprising, fulfilling ways possible.

so i started questioning: *how could real life be such an adventure?*

and soon later - if life is the biggest game/project we have, **why the hell are the tools we have for playing/managing it so much worse than we have for managing fictional characters?** 

and oh dear, that question has been sending me down into ever-deeper rabbit holes since then.

with the rate of technological progress, i didn't know what the world could look like in 5-10 years, much less who i'd become after that time. instead of trying to figure out exactly where i wanted to be and plan for an unknowable (though [[topics/design/futures studies\|foreseeable]]) future, i simply chose to try to become good at [[topics/player/learning\|learning]] itself - so i could be adaptable and learn anything whenever it was necessary.

there's tons to learn on the subject of [[meta-learning\|meta-learning]], that go beyond just *[[learning how to learn\|learning how to learn]].* it involved questioning *[[what to learn\|what to learn]]*. figuring out *[[inquiries & heuristics/what technology is actually worth building\|what is actually worth doing]]*. it gets very philosophical very quickly.

plus, during my brief period learning the basics of programming, i saw that even though there's some creativity to it, there's also a lot of rule-following in programming. a 15-year-old opinion is not much to base any conclusions on, but it seemed really obvious that we'd soon figure out a way to automate much of this process (turns out we did - hello [[topics/lab/large language models\|LLMs]] 🙃).

basically, i didn't want to be a [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss1us.lab\|builder]] for the sake of building things. i wanted to be an [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss1us.design\|architect]] first.

 i'm not saying this was the "right" approach, nor that it hasn't actually hindered me in many ways, but this path helped me to see much more clearly what i deem as the role of [[topics/design/technology\|technology]] and [[digital systems\|digital systems]] today - see: [[inquiries & heuristics/what technology is actually worth building\|what technology is actually worth building]]⁹⁸.

#### major challenges to be addressed / fields to work on:

once familiarized with the basics of [[_006_core notes/design philosophies\|design philosophies]]⁹⁸ such as [[models & frameworks/design/humane design\|humane]]/[[human-centered design\|human-centered design]] and then moving into [[more-than-human-centered design\|more-than-human-centered]], [[concepts/design/circular design\|circular]], [[responses/regen/regenerative design\|regenerative]] and [[responses/design/values-based design\|values-based design]], the orienting question i've been holding in this field is:

- how can technology support [[topics/design/regeneration\|regenerative]] forms of [[_004_L1F3/core concepts/civilization design\|civilization design]], [[_004_L1F3/core concepts/life design\|life design]] and [[_004_L1F3/core concepts/self-transformation\|self-transformation]]?

my current findings/[[_006_core notes/theories of change\|theory of change]]⁹⁸ has been that we need to develop: 

##### 1) a coherent [[concepts/design/sensemaking layer\|sensemaking layer]] on and off the web

[[information systems\|information systems]] -> [[projects & tools/made by me/lab/reality mapping\|reality maps]]⁹⁶, [[concepts/design/knowledge ecologies\|knowledge ecologies]]⁹⁶, [[material\|material]]/[[accounting systems\|accounting systems]]⁹⁸, [[topics/design/research\|research]]⁹⁷, [[topics/design/curation\|curation]]⁹⁶ & [[concepts/alchemy/sensemaking\|sensemaking]]⁹⁸ systems.

##### 2) better [[topics/design/coordination systems\|coordination systems]]⁹⁸

[[topics/design/distributed systems\|distributed]]/[[decentralized systems\|decentralized systems design]] -> global scale: [[diagnosis/self-terminating economic system\|economic]], [[governance systems\|governance]], [[organizational systems\|organizational]], [[self-organizing systems\|self-organizing systems]]
and local-personal scale: [[concepts/design/resources\|resources]], [[responses/lab/knowledge management\|knowledge]], [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1us’ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/archive/databases/general skills master list/data management\|data]] & [[self-management systems\|self-management systems]].

##### 3) [[_004_L1F3/core concepts/self-management\|self-management]]⁹⁷ & [[topics/design/collaboration tools\|collaboration tools]]⁹⁷

[[concepts/design/tools for extended cognition\|tools for extended cognition]] -> [[models & frameworks/design/OODA loop\|OODA loop]]⁹⁷ augmentation / [[models & frameworks/design/DIKW pyramid\|DIKW]] management ([[concepts/alchemy/sensemaking\|sensemaking]], [[topics/lab/information management\|information management]], [[knowledge development\|knowledge development]], [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1us’ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/archive/databases/industries master list/wisdom development\|wisdom development]])

[[_004_L1F3/core concepts/life management\|life management]] -> [[_004_L1F3/l1f3 management ontology\|l1f3 management ontology]] & [[_002_toolkit/000 ⛓ l1f3 player toolkit\|toolkit]] -> [[concepts/lab/memex\|memex]], [[co-pilot\|co-pilot]], [[responses/lab/recommender systems\|recommender systems]], [[topics/lab/algorithms\|algorithms]], [[responses/lab/mapping\|maps]], [[responses/lab/dashboards\|dashboards]] & more

[[concepts/lab/personal tech stack\|personal & collective tech stacks]] -> [[personal computing\|personal computing]] -> [[responses/lab/permacomputing\|permacomputing]] / [[responses/design/trust networks\|trust networks]] / [[local-first\|local-first]] tech

#### key guiding directions/ideas:

1) how might we design & build new [[economic systems\|economic systems]] that address the foundational [[economic incentives\|economic incentives]] for [[diagnosis/accumulation, extraction, abstraction\|accumulation, extraction, abstraction]] that are driving the [[concepts/design/metacrisis\|metacrisis]]?

[[topics/design/web3\|web3]], [[topics/design/refi\|refi]], [[topics/design/financial incentives for open-source software\|financial incentives for open-source software]], [[topics/player/game theory\|game theory]], (...)

2) how might we [[responses/lab/adapt existing systems\|adapt existing systems]] (reducing harm & expanding utility), while also developing [[diagnosis/systemic collapse\|post-collapse]], [[topics/design/regeneration\|regenerative]] [[concepts/design/infrastructure\|infrastructure]]?

[[responses/lab/permacomputing\|permacomputing]], [[low-tech\|low-tech]] approaches, [[_001_MOCs/050 🟩 mid game/070 🔩 prototypes MOC\|prototypes]], etc.

1) what is the role of computers and computation in a [[regenerative society\|regenerative society]]?

a humane [[concepts/lab/dynamic medium\|dynamic medium]]: one that integrates [[responses/lab/dynamic visualizations\|dynamic visualizations]], [[world models\|world models]], [[knowledge representations\|knowledge representations]], [[topics/lab/spatial computing\|spatial computing]], [[concepts/design/extended cognition\|extended cognition]] and more to effectively... (see below)

2) how might we empower ourselves and our communities to navigate the [[concepts/design/metacrisis\|metacrisis]] and create [[omni-win systems\|omni-win systems]]?
 
augmenting our [[models & frameworks/design/OODA loop\|OODA loop]]: 1) [[tools for self-transformation\|tools for self-transformation]] -> 2) tools for [[concepts/alchemy/sensemaking\|sensemaking]] / [[concepts/design/tools for extended cognition\|tools for extended cognition]] -> 3) tools for [[_004_L1F3/core concepts/self-management\|self-management]] -> 4) [[topics/design/collaboration tools\|tools for collaboration]] -> 5) [[topics/design/coordination systems\|coordination systems]] / [[self-actualization\|self-actualization]] systems.

3) how might we get started with designing, building and applying these systems/tools, despite the [[economic\|economic]] and [[concepts/design/infrastructure\|infrastructure]] challenges today?

extremely intentional [[experiments/made by me/design/minimum viable intentional personal systems design;setup\|personal systems design]]: developing across 4 dimensions of a wholistic collaborative [[_004_L1F3/l1f3 management system\|life management system]]. leveraging [[topics/lab/algorithms\|algorithms]], [[responses/design/trust networks\|trust networks]], [[low-tech\|low-tech]] and other forms of existing [[collaborative infrastructure\|collaborative infrastructure]].
