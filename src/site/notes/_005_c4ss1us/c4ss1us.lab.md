#### major challenges to be addressed / fields to work on:

[[topics/architect;design/systems design\|systems design]] -> [[diagnosis/self-terminating economic system\|economic systems]], [[governance systems\|governance systems]], [[informational systems\|informational systems]], [[knowledge systems\|knowledge systems]]
[[computing stack\|computing stack]] -> [[responses/regen/permacomputing\|permacomputing]]
[[software stack\|software stack]] -> [[topics/architect;design/distributed systems\|distributed systems]]
[[concepts/alchemy/sensemaking\|sensemaking]]/[[topics/lab/information management\|information management]]/[[knowledge development\|knowledge development]]/[[wisdom development\|wisdom development]] -> 
[[topics/lab/personal knowledge management\|personal knowledge management]] -> 
[[_004_L1F3/core concepts/life management\|life management]] -> [[memex\|memex]], [[_004_L1F3/l1f3 management ontology\|life management methodology]]

#### key guiding directions/ideas:

1) how might we design & build new [[economic systems\|economic systems]] that address the foundational [[economic incentives\|economic incentives]] for [[diagnosis/accumulation, extraction, abstraction\|accumulation, extraction, abstraction]] that are driving the [[concepts/design/metacrisis\|metacrisis]]?

[[topics/architect;design/web3\|web3]], [[topics/architect;design/refi\|refi]], [[topics/architect;design/financial incentives for open-source software\|financial incentives for open-source software]], (...)

2) how might we [[adapt existing systems\|adapt existing systems]] (reducing harm & expanding utility) vs developing [[topics/architect;design/systemic collapse\|post-collapse]], [[topics/architect;design/regeneration\|regenerative]] [[concepts/design/infrastructure\|infrastructure]]?

[[responses/regen/permacomputing\|permacomputing]], [[low-tech\|low-tech]] approaches, [[_001_MOCs/050 🟩 mid game/070 🔩 prototypes MOC\|prototypes]], etc.

3) what is the role of computers and computation in a [[regenerative society\|regenerative society]]?

a humane [[dynamic medium\|dynamic medium]]: one that integrates [[responses/lab/dynamic visualizations\|dynamic visualizations]], [[world models\|world models]], [[knowledge representations\|knowledge representations]], [[topics/lab/spatial computing\|spatial computing]], [[concepts/design/extended cognition\|extended cognition]] and more to effectively... (see below)

4) how might we empower ourselves and our communities to navigate the [[concepts/design/metacrisis\|metacrisis]] and create [[omni-win systems\|omni-win systems]]?
 
augmenting our [[models & frameworks/design/OODA loop\|OODA loop]]: 1) [[tools for self-transformation\|tools for self-transformation]] -> 2) tools for [[concepts/alchemy/sensemaking\|sensemaking]] / [[tools for extended cognition\|tools for extended cognition]] -> 3) tools for [[_004_L1F3/core concepts/self-management\|self-management]] -> 4) [[topics/architect;design/collaboration tools\|tools for collaboration]] -> 5) [[topics/architect;design/coordination systems\|coordination systems]] / [[self-actualization\|self-actualization]] systems.

5) how might we get started with designing, building and applying these systems/tools, despite the [[economic\|economic]] and [[concepts/design/infrastructure\|infrastructure]] challenges today?

extremely intentional [[experiments/made by me/design/minimum viable intentional personal systems design;setup\|personal systems design]]: developing across 4 dimensions of a wholistic collaborative [[_004_L1F3/l1f3 management system\|life management system]]. leveraging [[topics/lab/algorithms\|algorithms]], [[responses/design/trust networks\|trust networks]], [[low-tech\|low-tech]] and other forms of existing [[collaborative infrastructure\|collaborative infrastructure]].

#### relevant existing topics/resources:

see: [[references/lab/github starred repositories\|github lists]]

\+ weighted [[_001_MOCs/025 🔷 long game/025 🗺 topics & references MOC\|topics]] map:
