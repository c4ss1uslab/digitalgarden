#### a brief personal context

back when i was 15 years old (2014), i had a quasi-spiritual experience while deciding what the hell i should do with my life. i tell the full story [somewhere else], but in short, i decided that even though i was a typical nerd, loved [[topics/player/gaming\|gaming]], and had an affinity for the logic and mathematics involved in [[topics/lab/programming\|programming]], i wouldn't learn it, at least for the foreseeable future.

when i started diving into it, for 2 weeks or so, i had a realization that i wasn't interested in programming per se, but in what could be built with it. sure, games are cool, but it dawned on me that [[_004_L1F3/l1f3 game\|life is the biggest game there is]].

i would have absolutely loved to have [[references/player/anime;manga;webtoon/sword art online\|sword art online]] (or more recent versions of "[[alternate reality gaming\|alternate reality gaming]]" such as [[references/player/anime;manga;webtoon/solo leveling\|solo leveling]] or [[references/player/anime;manga;webtoon/overgeared\|overgeared]]) in real life, but i also really wanted to figure out [[life as play - metagame design, mechanics and the l1f3 player toolkit\|how to play life as well as i can]]. in the most beautiful, cool, exciting, surprising, fulfilling ways possible.

i started questioning: *how could real life be such an adventure?*

and soon later - if life is the biggest game/project we have, **why the hell are the tools we have for playing/managing it so much worse than we have for managing fictional characters?** 

and oh dear, that question has been sending me down into rabbit holes ever since.

with the advances of technology, i didn't know what the world could look like in 5-10 years, much less who i'd become after that time. instead trying to figure out exactly where i wanted to be and plan for an unknowable (though [[topics/design/futures studies\|foreseeable]]) future, i could simply become good at [[topics/player/learning\|learning]] anything - whatever made itself necessary.

i.e. [[meta-learning\|meta-learning]] - *learning how to learn. questioning what to learn. figuring out [[inquiries & heuristics/what technology is actually worth building\|what is actually worth building]]*, instead.

plus, during my two weeks moving beyond simple CSS/HTML and learning the basics of programming, i saw that even though there's some creativity to it, there's a lot of engineering, or put another way - rule-following in programming. well, that's not much to base any conclusions on, but it seemed really obvious that we'd soon figure out a way to automate much of this process (turns out we did - hello [[topics/lab/large language models\|LLMs]] üôÉ).

basically, i didn't want to be a [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss1us.lab\|builder]] for the sake of building things. i wanted to be an [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss1us.design\|architect]] first.

 i'm not saying this was the right approach, nor that it hasn't actually hindered me in many ways, but this path helped me to see much more clearly what i deem as the role of [[topics/design/technology\|technology]] and [[digital systems\|digital systems]] today - see: [[inquiries & heuristics/what technology is actually worth building\|what technology is actually worth building]].

#### major challenges to be addressed / fields to work on:

once familiarized with the basics of [[_006_core notes/design philosophies\|design philosophies]] such as [[models & frameworks/design/humane design\|humane]]/[[human-centered design\|human-centered design]] to then move into [[more-than-human-centered design\|more-than-human-centered]], [[concepts/design/circular design\|circular]], [[responses/regen/regenerative design\|regenerative]] and [[responses/design/values-based design\|values-based design]], the orienting question i hold in this field is:

- how can technology support [[topics/design/regeneration\|regenerative]] [[_004_L1F3/core concepts/civilization design\|civilization design]], [[_004_L1F3/core concepts/life design\|life design]] and [[_004_L1F3/core concepts/self-transformation\|self-transformation]]?

my prevailing frame/[[_006_core notes/theories of change\|theory of change]] has been that we need to develop: 
##### 1) a coherent [[concepts/design/sensemaking layer\|sensemaking layer]]

[[information systems\|information systems]] -> [[projects & tools/made by me/lab/reality mapping\|reality maps]], [[concepts/design/knowledge ecologies\|knowledge ecologies]], [[topics/design/research\|research]], [[tbprocessed/base notes/concepts - general/curation\|curation]] & [[concepts/alchemy/sensemaking\|sensemaking]] systems.

##### 2) better [[topics/design/coordination systems\|coordination systems]]

[[topics/design/distributed systems\|distributed]]/[[decentralized systems\|decentralized systems design]] -> [[diagnosis/self-terminating economic system\|economic systems]], [[governance systems\|governance systems]], [[organizational systems\|organizational systems]], [[responses/lab/knowledge management\|knowledge management]], [[data management\|data management]] & [[self-management systems\|self-management systems]].

##### 3) [[_004_L1F3/core concepts/self-management\|self-management]] & [[topics/design/collaboration tools\|collaboration tools]]

[[tools for extended cognition\|tools for extended cognition]] -> [[models & frameworks/design/OODA loop\|OODA loop]] augmentation / [[models & frameworks/design/DIKW pyramid\|DIKW]] management ([[concepts/alchemy/sensemaking\|sensemaking]], [[topics/lab/information management\|information management]], [[knowledge development\|knowledge development]], [[wisdom development\|wisdom development]])

[[_004_L1F3/core concepts/life management\|life management]] -> [[_004_L1F3/l1f3 management ontology\|l1f3 management ontology]] & [[_002_toolkit/000 ‚õì l1f3 player toolkit\|toolkit]] -> [[concepts/lab/memex\|memex]], [[co-pilot\|co-pilot]], [[responses/lab/recommender systems\|recommender systems]], [[topics/lab/algorithms\|algorithms]], [[responses/lab/mapping\|maps]], [[responses/lab/dashboards\|dashboards]] & more

[[concepts/lab/personal tech stack\|personal & collective tech stacks]] -> [[personal computing\|personal computing]] -> [[responses/lab/permacomputing\|permacomputing]] / [[responses/design/trust networks\|trust networks]] / [[local-first\|local-first]] tech

#### core references:

below are mostly working digital [[_001_MOCs/050 üü© mid game/080 ‚öí tools MOC\|tools]] with similar scopes/objectives to what i consider important/necessary tech for the challenges/fields above - [[diagnosis/sensemaking crisis\|sensemaking]], [[topics/design/coordination systems\|coordination]], [[_004_L1F3/core concepts/self-management\|self-management]] and [[terms/collaboration\|collaboration]].

these references can serve both as [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss1us.design\|design]] references/case studies, as well as practical tools for personal/collective use. they are presented along with their associated [[patterns/active patterns/knowledge design/relevance score\|relevance scores]] - *and soon i'll add my [[patterns/active patterns/knowledge design/familiarity degree\|familiarity degree]], [[readiness score\|readiness score]] and [[information density\|information density]] in/of each one*.

for [[initiatives, orgs & communities/organizations MOC\|organizations]] conducting [[topics/design/research\|research]] and [[topics/lab/technology development\|development]], key [[_001_MOCs/025 üî∑ long game/020 ‚ùî concepts, questions & ideas MOC\|ideas]], [[papers\|papers]], and other relevant resources, i'll dedicate a whole [[publication\|publication]] to exploring them in the future, but down in this page you can already see some parts of it. the list below aims to give you a quick glimpse and way to navigate the most relevant references for the designs/prototypes i've been attempting to create.

1) how might we design & build new [[economic systems\|economic systems]] that address the foundational [[economic incentives\|economic incentives]] for [[diagnosis/accumulation, extraction, abstraction\|accumulation, extraction, abstraction]] that are driving the [[concepts/design/metacrisis\|metacrisis]]?

[[topics/design/web3\|web3]], [[topics/design/refi\|refi]], [[topics/design/financial incentives for open-source software\|financial incentives for open-source software]], [[topics/player/game theory\|game theory]], (...)

2) how might we [[responses/lab/adapt existing systems\|adapt existing systems]] (reducing harm & expanding utility), while also developing [[topics/design/systemic collapse\|post-collapse]], [[topics/design/regeneration\|regenerative]] [[concepts/design/infrastructure\|infrastructure]]?

[[responses/lab/permacomputing\|permacomputing]], [[low-tech\|low-tech]] approaches, [[_001_MOCs/050 üü© mid game/070 üî© prototypes MOC\|prototypes]], etc.

3) what is the role of computers and computation in a [[regenerative society\|regenerative society]]?

a humane [[concepts/lab/dynamic medium\|dynamic medium]]: one that integrates [[responses/lab/dynamic visualizations\|dynamic visualizations]], [[world models\|world models]], [[knowledge representations\|knowledge representations]], [[topics/lab/spatial computing\|spatial computing]], [[concepts/design/extended cognition\|extended cognition]] and more to effectively... (see below)

4) how might we empower ourselves and our communities to navigate the [[concepts/design/metacrisis\|metacrisis]] and create [[omni-win systems\|omni-win systems]]?
 
augmenting our [[models & frameworks/design/OODA loop\|OODA loop]]: 1) [[tools for self-transformation\|tools for self-transformation]] -> 2) tools for [[concepts/alchemy/sensemaking\|sensemaking]] / [[tools for extended cognition\|tools for extended cognition]] -> 3) tools for [[_004_L1F3/core concepts/self-management\|self-management]] -> 4) [[topics/design/collaboration tools\|tools for collaboration]] -> 5) [[topics/design/coordination systems\|coordination systems]] / [[self-actualization\|self-actualization]] systems.

5) how might we get started with designing, building and applying these systems/tools, despite the [[economic\|economic]] and [[concepts/design/infrastructure\|infrastructure]] challenges today?

extremely intentional [[experiments/made by me/design/minimum viable intentional personal systems design;setup\|personal systems design]]: developing across 4 dimensions of a wholistic collaborative [[_004_L1F3/l1f3 management system\|life management system]]. leveraging [[topics/lab/algorithms\|algorithms]], [[responses/design/trust networks\|trust networks]], [[low-tech\|low-tech]] and other forms of existing [[collaborative infrastructure\|collaborative infrastructure]].
