**what would a game board for your life look like?**

it depends on how you understand life, what your values, goals and perceptions of reality look like, and what you deem important to visualize.

i'd argue that pretty much regardless of who you are, if you're interested in having more clarity/visibility in your life, some long-standing [[coaching frameworks\|coaching frameworks]] are quite helpful as a starting point.

plus, this frame of a [[game board\|game board]] introduces an interesting view of life as a game, and therefore, a set of useful definitions and frameworks from [[topics/player/game design\|game design]] become available:

**your life as:**
"a form of [[topics/player/play\|play]] with [[goals\|goals]] and [[structure\|structure]]."
"a set of [[rules\|rules]], [[guidelines\|guidelines]] and [[objectives\|objectives]] within an [[terms/environment\|environment]]."
"a set of [[goals\|goals]], [[rules\|rules]], [[challenges\|challenges]], and [[interactions\|interactions]]."
"(...) [[goals\|goals]], [[rules\|rules]], a [[feedback system\|feedback system]], and voluntary participation."
"an [[activity\|activity]] among two or more in(ter)dependent [[decision-makers\|decision-makers]] seeking to achieve their [[objectives\|objectives]] in some [[limiting context\|limiting context]]."
"a form of [[tbprocessed/base notes/concepts - general/art\|art]] in which participants, termed _players_, [[make decisions\|make decisions]] in order to [[manage resources\|manage resources]] through game tokens in the pursuit of a [[goal\|goal]]."

##### core design / mechanics

this game / board has 3 layers:

1) [[_004_L1F3/core concepts/self-management\|self-management]]/[[_004_L1F3/core concepts/self-transformation\|_004_L1F3/core concepts/self-transformation]]

(...)

2) [[_004_L1F3/core concepts/life design\|life design]]/[[_004_L1F3/core concepts/life management\|life management]]

most people spend most of their time here. the board intends to make visible the amount of systems, tools, actions and possibilities in this space, which are often taken for granted or simply underexplored/not seen, due to the sheer amount of information in the world and/or the current design of our dominant civilizational systems and of most people's lives, which don't incentivize further investigation/elaboration in this space.

3) [[_004_L1F3/core concepts/civilization design\|civilization design]]/[[civilization management\|civilization management]]

what's your contribution to the design and unfoldment of the world as a whole? whatever the scale of your work (personal, local, global), it may be interesting/useful to others somewhere out there who might take your ideas/creations and develop it further.
