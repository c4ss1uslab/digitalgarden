an initiative proposing a vision/prototypes for a new form of coordination - [[NAOs\|NAOs]]: networked adaptive organisms.

see: https://nao.is/

their vision of a tech stack for a "world wise web": https://standingwave.net/apps/simple_tech_stack/

##### a note of appreciation and caution

they're working in some incredibly relevant yet challenging territory. there are virtually no financial incentives for developing this vision in the existing economy. even if self-funding (like [[tbprocessed/base notes/ventures - general/SEEDS\|SEEDS]] did for a few years) or via philanthropy, the scope of the project is very big, plus the challenge of collaborating with other initiatives/distributed tech stacks presents a long-standing [[interoperability\|interoperability]] issue.

i believe this is a very worthy vision that aims to ignite the original spirit of collaboration from [[topics/design/web3\|web3]], but it has several challenges in order to finance itself, so my hope is that this reaches folks with a high degree of privilege that can dedicate themselves to working on it, while also gathering influential allies in the [[concepts/design/metacrisis\|metacrisis]]/[[governance\|governance]] spaces to support its adoption/ development.

i intend to support it/refer to it however i can in the upcoming future.
