https://sublime.app/ - founded by [[people/references/architect;design/sari azout\|sari azout]]

an early-stage public [[patterns/active patterns/knowledge management/building a second brain\|second brain]] tool mostly for knowledge [[capture\|capture]] and social [[topics/design/curation\|curation]]. i'd love for it to become something like what [[projects & tools/projects/lab/subconscious (tool)\|subconscious (tool)]] envisioned to be, and they seem to be on the right track, but i'm not sure if they'll have enough traction/business model to do so. cheering for it though, as i appreciate [[people/references/architect;design/sari azout\|sari azout]]'s tactfulness and care in her [[topics/design/humane tech design\|humane tech design]].
