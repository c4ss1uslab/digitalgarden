#### a few notes on it

they hold some really key points/perspectives on how we have to expand our capacity to care, hold space for and facilitate the immensely challenging conversations, agreements and healing processes we need to go through as a society.

their pedagogical approach/artifacts are great and their overall [tenderness](https://decolonialfutures.net/radicaltenderness/) reassure me that no matter their human fallibility they're on a path guided by [[source\|source]]. i see so many beautiful projects and beings that have their hearts in the right place failing to have the necessary depth/tools/resources to hold space for others, to convey their truth in a way that lands/resonates and to have the cognitive complexity to work towards responses that go beyond their local challenges/limited knowledge/immediate circle of care. it seems that their approach/collective is being able to work through all that, so i'm grateful.
