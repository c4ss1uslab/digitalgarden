i'm slowly reading the book "[[pedagogies of collapse\|pedagogies of collapse]]". they have a board game too ([[COLLAPSE\|COLLAPSE]], and i found their format of "[[experimental pedagogics\|experimental pedagogics]]", [projects](https://www.education4socialchange.com/projects) & [tools](https://www.education4socialchange.com/tools) seemingly pretty well-structured.
