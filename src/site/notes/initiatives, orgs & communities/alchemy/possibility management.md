###### my personal relationship with it:

in 2022-23, i went through an [[other notes ; references/possibility management/expand the box\|expand the box]] (their initiatory 5-day training), a [[other notes ; references/possibility management/possibility lab\|possibility lab]] (another 5-day training), as well as a group immersion led by one of their trainers (a ["possibilitator"](https://possibilitatortraining.mystrikingly.com/)) with a few soul friends/co-creators for a few days.

i also did quite a few "[[practices/emotional healing process\|emotional healing processes]]" (EHPs) and participated in a few of their other practices, such as the [[other notes ; references/possibility management/possibility teams\|possibility teams]], played their [[projects & tools/projects/player/startover.xyz\|startover.xyz]] game and did some derivative practices such as [[initiatives, orgs & communities/athlete/playfight\|playfight]] and the [[references/player/games/serious games/sanctuaries of attention game\|sanctuaries of attention game]] (both which i especially enjoyed).

overall, my experiences were powerful and significant, though expensive. [their websites](https://spaceport.mystrikingly.com/) are full of great resources, distinctions, experiments, but they can also be *very opinionated* about how certain things work without much to ground their research on, besides their empiric experience (like [[feelings\|feelings]]/[[emotions\|emotions]], [[practices/emotional healing process\|emotional healing processes]], [[trauma\|trauma]], and [[society\|society]] as a whole).

i recommend at least checking it out, but *only if/when you're coming from a grounded place and not if you're feeling fragile/uncentered/easily triggered*, as they can intensify this experience and not necessarily give you the tools/support to move through it.

while i believe it's a valuable experience to sign up for a few of their trainings/sessions, i don't fully endorse it because (from my experience) it can be a money hole that leads you to plunge into infinite healing, without helping you address other aspects of your life that might be leading to you being in that situation in the first place.

even though i resonate with a lot of their purpose and insights, i find them often (ironically, since they talk so much about [[radical responsibility\|radical responsibility]]) lacking in responsibility with handling people's [[life management/life areas (internal)/emotional\|emotional]]/[[topics/alchemy/trauma healing\|traumatic]] processes and in [[concepts/alchemy/epistemology\|epistemic]] humility.

on the first point, they're often asking people to hold space for other's emotional healing processes (such as in the [[ETB\|ETB]]) with minimal instructions/training, in a high-pressure environment (even though they call it a "safe space") and not much support for integration afterwards, which can just perpetuate the trauma further.

on the second point, i find it disconcerting how often they tend to negate/not engage with other lines of research at all. it's like there are no other "[[edgeworkers\|edgeworkers]]"/alchemists out there. they're the only ones. which creates a [[feedback loop\|feedback loop]] of ever more [[jargon\|jargon]] and [[empiricism\|empiricism]], which contributes to a [[cult\|cultish]] sense/behavior.

so unless you know what you're stepping into, i'd recommend checking out a few other places first.

a helpful distinction offered by the [[models & frameworks/player/fourgames\|fourgames]] and [[models & frameworks/alchemy/four facets of integral development\|four facets of integral development]] frameworks (which they don't use/know about):

they're very focused on [[concepts/alchemy/short game\|short]]/[[concepts/alchemy/deep game\|deep game]], missing awareness/distinctions on the [[concepts/alchemy/mid game\|mid]]/[[concepts/alchemy/long game\|long games]]. or in [[models & frameworks/alchemy/four facets of integral development\|four facets]] terms, they're very focused on [[concepts/alchemy/cleaning up\|cleaning up]] and [[concepts/alchemy/showing up\|showing up]], with some sprinkles of [[concepts/alchemy/growing up\|growing up]] and [[concepts/alchemy/waking up\|waking up]], but not much integration of other [[topics/alchemy/spiritual lineages\|wisdom traditions]] and modern [[academic\|academic]]/[[scientific research\|scientific research]].

they also have a reductionist view of money that doesn't understand the complexity and design of our [[economic systems\|economic systems]] and [[topics/design/crypto\|crypto]] economies, although they adopt a few good practices such as [[sliding scale pricings\|sliding scale pricings]], lots of free content and [copyleft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft) licenses on their intellectual work.

i believe they're aiming at wonderful directions with what they're doing with [[projects & tools/projects/player/startover.xyz\|startover.xyz]], [[other notes ; references/possibility management/possibility teams\|possibility teams]], [[concepts/alchemy/initiation\|initiations]], [[concepts/regen/gaian gameworlds\|gaian gameworlds]]/[[concepts/player/gameworld building\|gameworld building]], and more. but if they were more open to other [[_001_MOCs/025 ðŸ”· long game/025 ðŸ—º topics & references MOC\|fields of knowledge]]/[[concepts/alchemy/ways of knowing\|ways of knowing]], they'd be much better off.

i also find it (when in its [[shadow\|shadow]] aspects) to be very eurocentric/colonialist at times (even though they also claim to be creating [[archiarchy\|archiarchy]]), but i'll leave this comment/discussion for some other time. currently, it's still kind of an insular, cultish thing. often times made by them (facilitators), for themselves. valuable nonetheless.
