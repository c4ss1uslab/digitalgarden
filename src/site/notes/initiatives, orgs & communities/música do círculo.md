música do círculo is an institute that has created a practice that goes by the same name. it's a collective improvised music-making practice without any instruments and for people of all levels of experience, that works integrating several elements, being them: [[improvisation\|improvisation]], [[game\|games]], [[non-verbal communication\|non-verbal communication]], the [[circle\|circle]], [[body music\|body music]], [[contact\|contact]], [[movement\|movement]] and [[flow\|flow]].

the facilitators (also called conductors) propose several games involving these different elements at a time, while also encouraging and creating a safe space for the creative expression, experimentation and proposition by the group itself.

it's a crazy psycho-spiritual, physical, musical and relational practice that i discovered in june 2023 and since then have been to a retreat, 50+ sessions and intend on doing the 2-year facilitator training starting august 2024.

the field of deep listening it creates help us very quickly tap into the [[collective intelligence\|collective intelligence]] of the group, facilitating the [[emergence\|emergence]] of whatever's alive in each of us and connecting us with deeper layers of our [[musical intelligence\|musical intelligence]] and [[self-expression\|self-expression]].

the sessions are usually 1h30-long, and though i curate a few recordings that i like from a few sessions, the experience of watching them (especially online) vs participating is completely different. i strongly recommend you join one to experience its magic before watching it.

after you've done it, or if you're curious anyway, below are a few recordings i liked.
