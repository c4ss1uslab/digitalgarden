"We are pragmatic utopians, committed to practical action for a radically wiser, weller world. We create coliving hubs, start businesses, do research and engage in activism to pioneer a wiser culture. We are ordinary people who choose an extra-ordinary path, treading the middle way betweenÂ [Plum Village](https://www.plumvillage.uk/)Â and Silicon Valley."
