###### ðŸ”¥ recommendation level: 7/10

i recommend it, but take it with *a few* grains of salt.

read more below before jumping in.

###### my personal relationship with it:

in 2022-23, i went through an [[expand the box\|expand the box]] (their initiatory 5-day training), a [[possibility lab\|possibility lab]] (another 5-day training), as well as a group immersion led by a ["possibilitator"](https://possibilitatortraining.mystrikingly.com/) with a few soul friends/co-creators for a few days.

i also did quite a few "[[emotional healing process\|emotional healing processes]]" (EHPs) and participated in a few of their other practices, such as the [[possibility teams\|possibility teams]], played their [[projects & tools/startover.xyz\|startover.xyz]] game and did some derivative practices such as [[playfight\|playfight]] and the [[sanctuaries of attention game\|sanctuaries of attention game]] (which i especially enjoyed).

overall, my experiences were powerful and significant, though expensive. [their websites](https://spaceport.mystrikingly.com/) are full of great resources, distinctions, experiments, but they can also be *very opinionated* about how certain things work (like [[feelings\|feelings]]/[[emotions\|emotions]], [[emotional healing process\|emotional healing processes]], [[trauma\|trauma]], etc).

i strongly recommend checking it out, but only if/when you're coming from a grounded place and not if you're feeling fragile/uncentered/easily triggered, as they can intensify this experience and not necessarily give you the tools/support to move through it.

while i believe it's a valuable experience to sign up for a few of their trainings/sessions, i don't fully endorse it because (from my experience) it can be a money hole that leads you to plunge into infinite healing, without helping you address other aspects of your life that might be leading to you being in that situation in the first place.

so unless you know what you're stepping into, i'd recommend checking out a few [[other places\|other places]] first.

a helpful distinction offered by the [[models & frameworks/fourgames\|fourgames]] and [[concepts/four facets of integral development\|four facets of integral development]] frameworks (which they don't use/know about):

they're very focused on [[short game\|short]]/[[deep game\|deep game]], missing awareness/distinctions on the [[mid game\|mid]]/[[long game\|long games]]. or in [[concepts/four facets of integral development\|four facets]] terms, they're very focused on [[cleaning up\|cleaning up]] and [[showing up\|showing up]], with some sprinkles of [[growing up\|growing up]] and [[waking up\|waking up]], but not much integration of other [[spiritual lineages\|wisdom traditions]] and modern [[academic\|academic]]/[[scientific research\|scientific research]].

they also have a reductionist view of money that don't understand the complexity and design of our [[economic systems\|economic systems]] and [[crypto\|crypto]] economies, though they adopt a few good practices such as [[sliding scale pricings\|sliding scale pricings]], lots of free content and [copyleft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft) licenses on their intellectual work.

i believe they're aiming at wonderful directions with what they're doing on [[projects & tools/startover.xyz\|startover.xyz]], [[possibility teams\|possibility teams]], [[initiation\|initiations]], [[gaian gameworlds\|gaian gameworlds]]/[[gameworld building\|gameworld building]], and more. but if they were more open to other [[_000_MOCs/025 ðŸ”· long game/025 ðŸ—º topics & references MOC\|fields of knowledge]]/[[concepts/ways of knowing\|ways of knowing]], they'd be much better off.

i also find it (when in its [[shadow\|shadow]] aspects) to be very white/colonialist at times, but i'll leave this comment/discussion for some other time. now, it's still kind of an insular, cultish thing. often times made by them, for themselves. valuable nonetheless.
