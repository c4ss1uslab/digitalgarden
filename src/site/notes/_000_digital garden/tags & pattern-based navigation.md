##### tag-based navigation

most of the contents you'll find here can be filtered/navigated through a few lenses:

**7 major topics/archetypes:** #alchemy, #design, #art, #lab, #player, #host, #regen.
**4 stages of note maturity**: #ðŸ•³ *(very early, still not planted),* #ðŸŒ± *(early, seedling),* #ðŸŒ¿ *(growing, budding)* and #ðŸŒ² *(robust, evergreen).*
**4 levels [[cognitive complexity\|cognitive complexity]]**:  #absolutebeginner, #beginner, #intermediate, #advanced
**17 major categories:** #inquiry, #term, #concept, #heuristic, #framework, #methodology, #pattern, #experiment, #prototype, #resource, #diagnosis, #project, #topic, #response, #person, #organization, #institution.
**4 layers:** #personal, #local, #regional, #global.
**[[models & frameworks/design/three horizons\|3 horizons]]** of application: #h1 *(short-term, reduce harm),* #h2 *(mid-term, empower/create supportive conditions),* #h3 *(long-term, design new systems, games and institutions).*

##### pattern-based navigation

notes will have a few other features ([[patterns/pattern collections/knowledge design patterns\|patterns]]) to help further explore them:

- [[patterns/active patterns/knowledge design/relevance score\|relevance scores]] (0-100) - my own judgement on how relevant this note is in the context of the whole.
- [[patterns/active patterns/epistemic status\|epistemic status]] (0-10) - how confident i am over the contents of the note.
- [[hyperlinks\|hyperlinks]] - related notes to dive deeper and feed your curiosity.
