## hello! welcome to my digital garden! 🌷

this is a space comprised of 2 main parts:

1) publishing my structured [[topics/design/research\|research]]/[[tbprocessed/base notes/concepts - general/curation\|curation]] on the [[concepts/design/metacrisis\|metacrisis]] - i.e. the set of inter-unfolding crises that underline the current moment we're living in the history of human civilizations, and

2) my own developments & propositions integrating these references - especially in the fields of  [[concepts/alchemy/consciousness development\|consciousness development]], [[terms/design\|design]], [[topics/design/technology\|technology]], [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss.art\|art]], [[topics/regen/earth regeneration\|regeneration]] and [[concepts/player/game\|games]] as systemic responses to the metacrisis.

you'll also find loose notes - exploring different [[ideas\|ideas]], [[concepts/design/resources\|resources]], [[pathways\|pathways]] to create [[concepts/alchemy/thriving\|thriving]] societies, oriented towards supporting the [[concepts/alchemy/integral development\|integral development]] of individuals and our [[topics/design/systems\|systems]], instead of our dominant ones, based on [win-lose dynamics](https://civilizationemerging.com/new-economics-series-3/) and [extractivist paradigms](https://civilizationemerging.com/new-economics-series-4/) that are destroying the planetary systems we depend upon, promoting profound [[diagnosis/intimacy crisis\|psycho-spiritual alienation]] and leading us towards impeding [[topics/design/systemic collapse\|systemic collapse]].

*⚠ note: this garden is under intense development! most notes are works-in-progress and may have a few disconnected phrases, references and links scattered throughout. explore at your own risk or come back in a few weeks/months when they're more mature! :)*

> > "a digital garden is something inbetween a personal blog and a wiki. it's a collection of evolving notes, essays, and ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date. they're inherently exploratory – posts are linked through contextual associations (bi-directional links). they aren't refined or complete - posts can be published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. they're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal "blogs" we're used to encountering on the web." - [[people/references/lab/maggie appleton\|maggie appleton]] on [digital gardening tools and resources](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners).
> 
> the digital garden [metaphor](https://maggieappleton.com/metaphors-web) can go a really long way. understanding your knowledge as a web of relationships can make us question, manage and design our [[information ecologies\|information ecologies]] in more conscious ways. soon you'll be able to read more about my perspectives on knowledge management/sharing on [[_000_digital garden/about - my approach to knowledge development\|about - my approach to knowledge development]] post.

### ❔ how this space is structured

*notes in this garden have 4 growth stages:* #🕳 *(still not planted),* #🌱 *(seedling),* #🌿 *(budding)* and #🌲 *(evergreen).*

there are two ways you can navigate this space:

1) 🗺 a structured, organized, narrative way, in which i share the foundational concepts, references, tools and discoveries of my research/learning/work. (*still very early stage! i recommend you follow the second option, below.*)
2) 🕸 a loose, experimental, self-directed navigation on a topic-based index of notes, which is how the notes are planted in this space.

choose your path below!

#### 1) 🗺 my r&d - structured way

>

> 
> this comprises most of the "research" part of this work. most pages will be tagged with #alchemy or #design tags.
> 
> > **b) how can we make life more like a sacred [[concepts/player/game\|game]]?**
> 
> *a sacred game is not any kind of game.* it's one that's deeply *fun, collaborative, challenging, meaningful* and *fulfilling*.
> a game that honors the beauty and mystery of life, that challenges and supports us to flourish - to discover ourselves, unfold our potentials and share our gifts with others.
> 
> this comprises most of the "development" part of this work. most pages will be tagged with #lab, #regen  or #player tags.
> 
> some people have a resistance with the [[concepts/player/game\|game]] frame because of its often seen competitive, game-theoretical win-lose dynamics. i share that hesitation, in the normal sense of the term. that's why the concept of game i'm using here is closer to the [[concepts/design/infinite games\|infinite game]] and [[omni-win dynamics\|omni-win dynamics]] observed by thinkers such as [[projects & tools/projects/player/world game\|buckminster fuller in the world game]] and communities such as [[models & frameworks/player/fourgames\|fourgames]], [[initiatives, orgs & communities/design/metagame.wtf\|metagame.wtf]] and [[projects & tools/projects/player/startover.xyz\|startover.xyz]].
>
> **why not just "play" then?**
> 
> because games introduce the distinction of [[concepts/player/serious play\|serious play]]. a game can be a container in which you feel like you truly "gave it your best" - it may be an epic journey in which you thrive and learn/gather feedback from that - or you can also fail miserably and learn a bunch of other lessons from that. it provides a context for a profound, immediate, experiential form of learning, since you have a very tight application of the [[models & frameworks/design/OODA loop\|OODA loop]].

##### core essays

*\*disclaimer:* my aim here isn't to provide definitive answers, but starting points. my hope if for this curation to serve as an overview, to give us some clarity of the territory and empower us as [[sensemakers\|sensemakers]] and infinite [[players\|players]]. so we can start playing these [[metagames\|metagames]] more consciously, effortlessly and collaboratively.

#### relevance score visualizations

i still have to figure out why the [digital garden plugin](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/) i'm using isn't allowing me to show the relevance score property on my notes. i currently have 197 notes with assigned relevance scores over 80 (max 100), and i'm slowly adding it to more and more of them (mostly [[terms/design\|design]] & [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss1us.lab\|lab]] notes were tagged so far, so the index below is missing a ton of stuff from [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss1us.alchemy\|alchemy]], [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss.art\|art]], [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss1us.player\|player]] and [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss1us.regen\|regen]], that are less developed).

i intend to fix this soon, but in the meantime, while i'm also building other views to help navigate this information - the [[_001_MOCs/025 🔷 long game/025 🗺 topics & references MOC\|025 🗺 topics & references MOC]] and [[_003_research/00 - viable pathways book-zine\|viable pathways]]' [[_003_research/05 - core references & resources\|05 - core references & resources]] pages - this is a useful visualization for navigating this research garden by identifying what i deem as most relevant from the areas above:

\**i've hid anything below 80 relevance score since - well, they're not as relevant at the moment, and therefore shouldn't clutter this visualization.*

#### additional information

##### how do I make my own garden?

i edit this using obsidian, a note-taking software that i use for my [second brain](https://maggieappleton.com/basb). you can start using the app by downloading it for free at [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md). there are many tutorials and possible advanced setups, but for starters, i recommend nick milo's ["obsidian for beginners" youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3NaIVgSlAVLHty1-NuvPa9V0b0UwbzBd) and his [LYT obsidian toolkit](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/_Start+Here).

to host my notes, i use the [obsidian digital garden plugin](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/) . it's quite easy to setup. but you can also pay for obsidian publish for a simpler setup.

##### how can i be in the loop for new content/updates on these projects?

sign up for my [newsletter](https://c4ss1us.substack.com/). also, if you want to be even more 'in the know', one possibility is to join a whatsapp group i created, in which i only occasionally share updates and exchange with a small group of friends. i'm leaving it open for new co-conspirators as well right now, as a way to approximate our relationship if you really feel the resonance. ❤ ask me about it on [telegram](https://t.me/c4ss1us).
