## hello! welcome to my digital garden! 🌷

![garden.jpeg|650](/img/user/images/photography%20&%20illustrations/garden.jpeg)
*ps: in case you arrived here but don't know who i am, you can find [👨🏻‍🎤 an introduction to my life, self and work here](https://c4ss1us.notion.site/c4ss1us/c4ss1us-hello-WIP-71130006ff1c42f69a32b7a46808a290).*

```ad-info
title: where am i? / what is this website?
collapse:
> "a digital garden is something inbetween a personal blog and a wiki. it's a collection of evolving notes, essays, and ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date. they're inherently exploratory – posts are linked through contextual associations (bi-directional links). they aren't refined or complete - posts can be published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. they're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal "blogs" we're used to encountering on the web."

if you want to know more, you can check out maggie appleton's amazing content for [a brief history & ethos of the digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) and [an extensive list of digital gardening tools and gardeners](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners).

the digital garden [metaphor](https://maggieappleton.com/metaphors-web) can go a really long way. understanding your knowledge as a web of relationships can make us question and design our [[information ecologies]] in more conscious ways. my approach/design for this space is ever evolving. you can read more about it in my [[about - my approach to knowledge development]] post.

keep in mind, the notes i tend to and share here are part of a *slow process of [[tbprocessed/base notes/concepts - general/sensemaking\|sensemaking]] and [[knowledge-building]]*. most of them will be messy, unfinished, poorly formatted, but they're still relevant/interesting enough that i choose to share. :)

if you want to see my more polished content, you can check my [newsletter](https://c4ss1us.substack.com/), [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/c4ss1us.l1f3/), [twitter](https://twitter.com/c4ss1usl1f3) (now X), and [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@c4ss1usl1f3). this is a behind-the-curtain view into my world and second brain. 😉
```

##### how to navigate this space

*notes in this garden have 3 growth stages:* #🌱 *(seedling),* #🌿 *(budding)* and #🌲 *(evergreen).*

there are two ways you can navigate this space:

1) 🗺 a structured, organized, narrative way, in which i share the foundational concepts, references, tools and discoveries of my research/learning/work.
2) 🕸 a loose, experimental, self-directed navigation on a topic-based index of notes, which is how the notes are planted in this space.

choose your path below!

## 1) 🗺 my research - structured way

![research overview 1.png|700](/img/user/images/made%20by%20me/research%20overview%201.png)
(*clickable soon!* *for now, you'll find a few essays below.*)

##### intro

the goal of my research was to map, understand and curate multiple cohesive approaches and possibilities to answer the question:

> **how can we address the profound spiritual/psychological, ecological, economic, sociopolitical, technological and educational challenges we're going through and create the more beautiful world our hearts know is possible?**

by sharing my findings, i aim to present what i see as viable pathways to address the [[concepts/metacrisis\|metacrisis]] and enable new, more [[resilient\|resilient]] & [[regenerative\|regenerative]] [[topics/architect;design/systems\|systems]], [[lifestyles\|lifestyles]] and [[ways of being\|ways of being]].

other inquiries i intend to address:

> **1) how can we support individuals and groups to create [[tbprocessed/base notes/concepts - general/art\|art]], [[topics/architect;design/technology\|technology]] and [[concepts/game\|games]] in service of [[concepts/consciousness development\|consciousness development]] and ecosystems [[topics/architect;design/regeneration\|regeneration]]?**

*a.k.a. how can we develop systems and structures to support life thriving on earth?*

> **2) how can we make life more like a game?**

*but not any kind of game.* a game that's deeply *fun, collaborative, challenging, meaningful* and *fulfilling*.
a game that honors the beauty and mystery of life, that challenges and supports us to flourish - to discover ourselves, unfold our potentials and share our gifts with others.

an inquiry into how can we:

> transform life into a real-world massive multiplayer online-and-offline collaborative self-transformation & civilization-building game.

</div></div>

(see more at: [[_004_L1F3/L1F3 game\|L1F3 game]])

games activate our sense of playfulness, but at the same time, seriousness. you can create a container in which you truly feel like you "gave it your best" (and it may be epic and you can thrive - and later gather feedback/learnings from that), or you can also fail miserably and learn a bunch of other lessons from that. it provides a context for a profound, experiential form of learning, since you essentially have a very tight form of the [[models & frameworks/OODA loop\|OODA loop]].

some people have a resistance with the [[concepts/game\|game]] frame because of its often seen competitive, game-theoretical win-lose dynamics. i share that hesitation, in the normal sense of the term. that's why the concept of game i'm using here is closer to the [[concepts/infinite games\|infinite game]] and [[omni-win dynamics\|omni-win dynamics]] observed by thinkers such as [[buckminster fuller\|buckminster fuller]] and communities such as [[models & frameworks/fourgames\|fourgames]], [[initiatives, orgs & communities/metagame.wtf\|metagame.wtf]] and [[projects & tools/startover.xyz\|startover.xyz]].

you can read a lot more about the motivations, background and philosophical basis of this research on my [[_003_research/00 - viable pathways book-zine\|viable pathways book-zine]].

my aim here isn't to provide definitive answers, but starting points. my hope if for this curation to serve as an overview, to give us some clarity of the territory and empower us as [[sensemakers\|sensemakers]] and regenerative [[players\|players]]. so we can start playing these [[concepts/game\|games]] more consciously, easily and collaboratively.

## 2) 🕸 loose navigation - notes breakdown

alternatively, if you want to explore these topics on your own, you can see below a high-level skeleton of the main projects, prototypes and references i've been working with. some of these will be more structured pages, others will be links to resources, others are still blank. follow your own judgment/curiosity! 🙃

### additional information

#### how do I make my own garden?

i edit this using obsidian, a note-taking software that I use for my [second brain](https://maggieappleton.com/basb). you can start using the app by downloading it for free at [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md). there are many tutorials and possible advanced setups, but for starters, i recommend nick milo's ["obsidian for beginners" youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3NaIVgSlAVLHty1-NuvPa9V0b0UwbzBd) and his [LYT obsidian toolkit](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/_Start+Here).

to host my notes, i use the [obsidian digital garden plugin](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/) .

#### how can i be in the loop for new content/updates on these projects?

sign up for my [newsletter](https://c4ss1us.substack.com/). also, if you want to be even more 'in the know', one possibility is to join a whatsapp group i created, in which i only occasionally share updates and exchange with a small group of friends. i'm leaving it open for new co-conspirators as well right now, as a way to approximate our relationship if you really feel the resonance. ❤ ask me about it on [telegram](https://t.me/c4ss1us) or via email at cassius dot carv at gmail dot com.
