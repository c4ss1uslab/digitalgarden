## hello! welcome to my digital garden! 🌷

for the past 6 years, i've been researching the complexity of the times we're living - our landscape of challenges and opportunities, asking *how to live in more ethical and regenerative ways*, as well as *how to create better systems for self-actualization and social coordination.*

this place is my public compilation (research garden) aiming to share my findings and continue to deepen the inquiry into:

> how can we create systems that better support us in playing, coordinating and collaborating towards more sacred & regenerative presents?

this space has 2 main types of content:

1) my open [[_002_research/00 - viable pathways book-zine\|research]]/diagnosis on the [[concepts/design/metacrisis\|metacrisis]] - i.e. our unique civilizational moment, which carries the seeds of potential for a profound [[systemic transformation\|systemic transformation]] and a [[concepts/alchemy/humanity's phase shift\|human phase shift]] into radically wiser, weller societies - as well as a set of escalating novel [[topics/design/systemic risks\|systemic risks]] and [interconnected crises](https://www.undp.org/blog/doing-development-polycrisis) that continue to unravel as part of our [[concepts/design/moloch\|persistent coordination failures]] as [[responses/design/second renaissance\|the first truly global society in the history of human civilizations]]\*.

2) my own [[_001_MOCs/050 🟩 mid game/060 🗡 projects MOC\|projects]], [[topics/design/curation\|curation]] and [[_006_core notes/theories of change\|theory of change]] (under development): [[_001_MOCs/050 🟩 mid game/090 🧪 experiments MOC\|experiments]], [[_001_MOCs/050 🟩 mid game/070 🔩 prototypes MOC\|prototypes]] and [[_001_MOCs/050 🟩 mid game/080 🖌 designs MOC\|designs]] integrating these perspectives into the [[_003_L1F3/L1F3 support systems\|L1F3 support systems]] and their propositions, exploring how [[concepts/alchemy/integral development\|consciousness development]], [[_006_core notes/design philosophies\|design]], [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss1us.lab\|technology]], [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss.art\|art]], [[responses/regen/regenerative design\|regeneration]] and [[concepts/player/game\|games]] can be systemic responses to the metacrisis.

these propositions/designs are presented in and can be applied at 4 different levels: #personal, #local, #regional, #global.

you'll also find loose notes - exploring different [[_002_research/07 - core ideas\|ideas]], [[_001_MOCs/050 🟩 mid game/resources MOC\|resources]], [[pathways\|pathways]] to create [[concepts/alchemy/thriving\|thriving]] lives and societies, oriented towards supporting the [[concepts/alchemy/integral development\|integral development]] of humans and the [[concepts/alchemy/flourishing\|flourishing]] of the whole, evolving from our dominant ones, based on [win-lose dynamics](https://civilizationemerging.com/new-economics-series-3/) and [extractivist paradigms](https://civilizationemerging.com/new-economics-series-4/) that are destroying the planetary systems we depend upon, promoting profound [[diagnosis/intimacy crisis\|psycho-spiritual alienation]] and leading us towards impeding [[diagnosis/systemic collapse\|systemic collapse]].

> i've been tending to this public space for the past ~2 years. it already has a lot of content, but most of it is still early stage. 🌱 please consider this while exploring. 🙃

\**one might make the case that we're not really a global society, since there are still some uncontacted tribes and communities that don't have access to much of our global infrastructure, such as media and the internet, however, we're already deeply globalized not just in terms of supply chains but also in terms of risks. any country with access to nuclear weapons, plus the acceleration of AI, ecological crises, biotechnology, and a series of other growing risks have the potential to harm the planet in ways that are consequential or even catastrophic for all of humanity and the other species on earth.*

##### a visual overview

![research overview.excalidraw.png](/img/user/_007_illustrations%20&%20sketches/research%20overview.excalidraw.png)

these are the main themes we'll cover here.

for clarity: the way i use the terms "[[concepts/player/game\|games]]" and "[[topics/design/systems\|systems]]" is (often) interchangeable. and the way i refer to technology is broadly as: *social, analog, digital and ancestral technologies* - a mix of both [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss1us.design\|systems design]] and [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss1us.lab\|technological development]].

we'll dive into deep analyses of the [[concepts/design/metacrisis\|metacrisis]], references from different [[worldviews\|worldviews]] on navigating our crises and reality itself, analyses of the deeper philosophical underpinnings of these perspectives, such as [[responses/alchemy/integral theory\|integral meta-theory]], [[responses/alchemy/cosmoerotic humanism\|cosmoerotic humanism]], [[concepts/alchemy/decolonization\|decolonial theory]], [[responses/alchemy/metarelationality\|metarelationality]] and [[responses/alchemy/metamodernism\|metamodernism]], the different [[_006_core notes/theories of change\|theories of change]] emerging out of these approaches, [[_006_core notes/design philosophies\|design approaches]] that can be applied at different levels of depth towards systems transformation and the design of new systems - and finally, maps, examples and opportunities of [[_001_MOCs/050 🟩 mid game/055 💼 ventures & initiatives MOC\|initiatives]], [[_001_MOCs/050 🟩 mid game/060 🗡 projects MOC\|projects]] and [[_001_MOCs/050 🟩 mid game/080 ⚒ tools MOC\|tools]] across these different domains ([[concepts/alchemy/consciousness\|consciousness]], [[tbprocessed/base notes/concepts - general/art\|art]], [[topics/design/technology\|technology]], [[topics/design/regeneration\|regeneration]], [[topics/design/systems\|systems]]/[[concepts/player/game\|games]]) putting all of this into practice.

### how to navigate this space

> [!info]- for first-time visitors:
> 
> this place is already an unconventional place since it's a [[_000_digital garden/c4ss1us' garden#^4b1c64\|digital garden]] full of hyperlinks. i will further go on here and propose a set of *tags* and specific [[patterns/pattern collections/knowledge design patterns\|knowledge design patterns]], that can help you better navigate this complex information at different layers of depth.
> 
> if you want, you can just skip this session to see a list right next, which contains almost all of my published notes ranked by (my own biased) order of relevance, which should give you a good overview of what i/this place is all about.
> 
> this might be a little too much information at first glance, but it should improve your experience over time. as you navigate more, you can get back to this, and i believe you'll start seeing its usefulness growing. :)

just click anywhere that draw your attention and follow your curiosity. otherwise, here are a few more structured possibilities:

most of the contents you'll find here can be filtered/navigated through a few lenses:

**7 major topics/archetypes:** #alchemy, #design, #art, #lab, #player, #host, #regen.
**4 stages of note maturity**: #🕳 *(very early, still not planted),* #🌱 *(early, seedling),* #🌿 *(growing, budding)* and #🌲 *(robust, evergreen).*
**4 levels [[cognitive complexity\|cognitive complexity]]**:  #absolutebeginner, #beginner, #intermediate, #advanced
**17 major categories:** #inquiry, #term, #concept, #heuristic, #framework, #methodology, #pattern, #experiment, #prototype, #resource, #diagnosis, #project, #topic, #response, #person, #organization, #institution.
**4 layers:** #personal, #local, #regional, #global.
**[[models & frameworks/design/three horizons\|3 horizons]]** of application: #h1 *(short-term, reduce harm),* #h2 *(mid-term, empower/create supportive conditions),* #h3 *(long-term, design new systems, games and institutions).*

and a few more to come...

notes will have a few other features to help further explore them:

- [[patterns/active patterns/knowledge design/relevance score\|relevance scores]] (0-100) - my own judgement on how relevant this note is in the context of the whole.
- [[patterns/active patterns/epistemic status\|epistemic status]] (0-10) - how confident i am over the contents of the note.
- [[hyperlinks\|hyperlinks]] - related notes to dive deeper and feed your curiosity.

> "a digital garden is something inbetween a personal blog and a wiki. it's a collection of evolving notes, essays, and ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date. they're inherently exploratory – posts are linked through contextual associations (bi-directional links). they aren't refined or complete - posts can be published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. they're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal "blogs" we're used to encountering on the web." - [[people/references/lab/maggie appleton\|maggie appleton]] on [digital gardening tools and resources](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners).
> 
> the digital garden [metaphor](https://maggieappleton.com/metaphors-web) can go a really long way. understanding your knowledge as a web of relationships can make us question, manage and design our [[information ecologies\|information ecologies]] in more conscious ways. i'm compiling my perspectives on knowledge design/management/sharing on the page: [[_000_digital garden/about - my approach to knowledge development\|about - my approach to knowledge development]], but it's stil learly.

> for now, if you want to know more, you can check out [[people/references/lab/maggie appleton\|maggie]]'s amazing content on [a brief history & ethos of the digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), [[people/references/architect;design/daniel schmachtenberger\|daniel schmachtenberger]]'s [the war on sensemaking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LqaotiGWjQ&list=PLj8H7uBaUwDvd18QrEPugPMD5Z6Y0W-vB&index=5) and my thoughts on the fields of [[responses/lab/tools for thought\|tools for thought]] and [[topics/lab/personal knowledge management\|personal knowledge management]] as a whole.

### ❔ where do i start?

here are two ways to help you navigate this space:

**a)** 🕸 *a loose, experimental, self-directed navigation based on hyperlinks/tags/patterns (above) or a relevance-based index of notes (below).*

or:

**b)** 🗺 *a structured, organized, narrative way, in which i share the foundational concepts, references, tools and discoveries of my research/learning/work. (still very early stage! i recommend you follow the first option.)*

choose your path below!

#### a) 🕸 loose navigation - notes breakdown

so far most of my well-tended notes are on the topics/archetypes of [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss1us.design\|design]] and [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss1us.lab\|lab]], so the index below is missing a ton of stuff from [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss1us.alchemy\|alchemy]], [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss.art\|art]], [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss1us.player\|player]], [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss.host\|host]] and [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss1us.regen\|regen]], that are less developed.

also, what's relevant for me may not be relevant for you, yet some aspects may have a [[transversal\|transversal]] impact. this gives a very big picture/overarching view of everything that i consider 90+, so you can find synergies between our interests, references and fields of study. another option would be to go deeper into: my [[_002_research/03 - foundational inquiries, principles & heuristics\|core inquiries]] (soon).

#### additional information

##### how do I make my own garden?

i edit this using obsidian, a note-taking software that i use for my [second brain](https://maggieappleton.com/basb). you can start using the app by downloading it for free at [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md). there are many tutorials and possible advanced setups, but for starters, i recommend nick milo's ["obsidian for beginners" youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3NaIVgSlAVLHty1-NuvPa9V0b0UwbzBd) and his [LYT obsidian toolkit](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/_Start+Here).

to host my notes, i use the [obsidian digital garden plugin](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/) . it's quite easy to setup. but you can also pay for obsidian publish for a simpler setup.

##### how can i be in the loop for new content/updates on these projects?

sign up for my [newsletter](https://c4ss1us.substack.com/). also, if you want to be even more 'in the know', one possibility is to join a whatsapp group i created, in which i only occasionally share updates and exchange with a small group of friends. i'm leaving it open for new co-conspirators as well right now, as a way to approximate our relationship if you really feel the resonance. ❤ ask me about it on [telegram](https://t.me/c4ss1us).
