## hello! welcome to my digital garden! 🌷

this is the space in which i'm:

a) publishing my research/curation and proto-designs on [[concepts/consciousness\|consciousness]], [[topics/architect;design/technology\|technology]], [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss.art\|art]], [[topics/regen/earth regeneration\|regeneration]] and [[concepts/game\|games]] as responses to the [[concepts/metacrisis\|metacrisis]] - the uniquely challenging moment we're living in the history of our civilization, and

b) planting notes - exploring different [[ideas\|ideas]], [[resources\|resources]], [[pathways\|pathways]] to create [[thriving\|thriving]] societies, oriented towards supporting the [[concepts/integral development\|integral development]] of individuals and institutions, instead of the one we have, based on [[win-lose dynamics\|win-lose dynamics]] and [[extractivist paradigms\|extractivist paradigms]] that are [[debasing our ecological substrate\|debasing our ecological substrate]], promoting profound [[psycho-spiritual alienation\|psycho-spiritual alienation]] and leading us towards impeding [[systemic collapse\|systemic collapse]].

### ❔ how this space is structured

*notes in this garden have 3 growth stages:* #🌱 *(seedling),* #🌿 *(budding)* and #🌲 *(evergreen).*

there are two ways you can navigate this space:

1) 🗺 a structured, organized, narrative way, in which i share the foundational concepts, references, tools and discoveries of my research/learning/work.
2) 🕸 a loose, experimental, self-directed navigation on a topic-based index of notes, which is how the notes are planted in this space.

choose your path below!

#### 1) 🗺 my research - structured way

![research overview 1.png|700](/img/user/images/made%20by%20me/research%20overview%201.png)
(*clickable soon!* *for now, you'll find a few essays below.*)

##### intro

the goal of my research was to map, understand and curate multiple cohesive approaches and possibilities to answer the question:

> **how can we address the profound spiritual/psychological, ecological, economic, sociopolitical, technological and educational challenges we're going through and create the more beautiful world our hearts know is possible?**

i.e. the [[inner\|inner]] and [[outer\|outer]] dimensions of the [[concepts/metacrisis\|metacrisis]].

by sharing my findings, i aim to establish some foundational [[knowledge commons\|knowledge commons]] to support us in navigating this complexity and enabling new, more [[resilient\|resilient]], [[regenerative\|regenerative]] [[topics/architect;design/systems\|systems]], [[topics/architect;design/lifestyles\|lifestyles]] and [[ways of being\|ways of being]].

a couple [[investigation trails\|investigation trails]] we'll dive into here are:

> **1) how can we support individuals and groups to create [[tbprocessed/base notes/concepts - general/art\|art]], [[topics/architect;design/technology\|technology]] and [[concepts/game\|games]] in service of [[concepts/consciousness development\|consciousness development]] and ecosystems [[topics/architect;design/regeneration\|regeneration]]?**

*a.k.a. how can we develop systems and structures to support life thriving on earth?*

> **2) how can we make life more like a sacred [[concepts/game\|game]]?**

*a sacred game is not any kind of game.* it's one that's deeply *fun, collaborative, challenging, meaningful* and *fulfilling*.
a game that honors the beauty and mystery of life, that challenges and supports us to flourish - to discover ourselves, unfold our potentials and share our gifts with others.

an inquiry into how we can:

> transform life into a real-world massive multiplayer online-and-offline collaborative self-transformation & regenerative civilization-building game.

</div></div>

(see more at: [[_004_L1F3/L1F3.game\|L1F3.game]])

some people have a resistance with the [[concepts/game\|game]] frame because of its often seen competitive, game-theoretical win-lose dynamics. i share that hesitation, in the normal sense of the term. that's why the concept of game i'm using here is closer to the [[concepts/infinite games\|infinite game]] and [[omni-win dynamics\|omni-win dynamics]] observed by thinkers such as [[projects & tools/projects/player/world game\|buckminster fuller in the world game]] and communities such as [[models & frameworks/fourgames\|fourgames]], [[initiatives, orgs & communities/architect;design/metagame.wtf\|metagame.wtf]] and [[projects & tools/projects/player/startover.xyz\|startover.xyz]].

games activate our sense of [[serious play\|serious play]]. you can create a container in which you truly feel like you "gave it your best" (and it may be an epic journey in which you thrive - and learn/gather feedback from that), or you can also fail miserably and learn a bunch of other lessons from that. it provides a context for a profound, experiential form of learning, since you have a very tight form of the [[models & frameworks/OODA loop\|OODA loop]].

my aim here isn't to provide definitive answers, but starting points. my hope if for this curation to serve as an overview, to give us some clarity of the territory and empower us as [[sensemakers\|sensemakers]] and infinite [[players\|players]]. so we can start playing these [[metagames\|metagames]] more consciously, easily and collaboratively.

#### relevance score visualizations

i still have to figure out why the [digital garden plugin](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/) i'm using isn't allowing me to show the relevance score property on my notes. i currently have 46 notes with assigned relevance scores over 80, and i'm slowly adding it to more and more of them (mostly [[terms/design\|design]]/[[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss1us.design\|architect]] & [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss1us.lab\|lab]] notes were tagged so far, so the index below is missing a ton of stuff from [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss1us.alchemy\|alchemy]], [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss.art\|art]], [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss1us.player\|player]] and [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss1us.regen\|regen]], that are less processed/more embrionary).

i intend to fix this soon, but in the meantime, while i'm also building the [[_001_MOCs/025 🔷 long game/025 🗺 topics & references MOC\|025 🗺 topics & references MOC]] and [[_003_research/00 - viable pathways book-zine\|viable pathways]]' [[_003_research/05 - core references & resources\|05 - core references & resources]] pages, this is a useful visualization for navigating this research garden by identifying what i deem as most relevant from the areas above:

\**i've hid anything below 80 relevance score since - well, they're not as relevant at the moment, and therefore shouldn't clutter this visualization.*

#### additional information

##### how do I make my own garden?

i edit this using obsidian, a note-taking software that I use for my [second brain](https://maggieappleton.com/basb). you can start using the app by downloading it for free at [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md). there are many tutorials and possible advanced setups, but for starters, i recommend nick milo's ["obsidian for beginners" youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3NaIVgSlAVLHty1-NuvPa9V0b0UwbzBd) and his [LYT obsidian toolkit](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/_Start+Here).

to host my notes, i use the [obsidian digital garden plugin](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/) .

##### how can i be in the loop for new content/updates on these projects?

sign up for my [newsletter](https://c4ss1us.substack.com/). also, if you want to be even more 'in the know', one possibility is to join a whatsapp group i created, in which i only occasionally share updates and exchange with a small group of friends. i'm leaving it open for new co-conspirators as well right now, as a way to approximate our relationship if you really feel the resonance. ❤ ask me about it on [telegram](https://t.me/c4ss1us) or via email at cassius dot carv at gmail dot com.
