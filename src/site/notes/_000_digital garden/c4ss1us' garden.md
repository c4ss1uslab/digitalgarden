## hello! welcome to my digital garden! 🌷

this is a space in which i'm:

a) publishing my [[topics/architect;design/research\|research]]/[[tbprocessed/base notes/concepts - general/curation\|curation]] and [[_001_MOCs/050 🟩 mid game/070 🔩 prototypes MOC\|proto]]-[[designs\|designs]] on [[concepts/alchemy/consciousness\|consciousness]], [[topics/architect;design/technology\|technology]], [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss.art\|art]], [[topics/regen/earth regeneration\|regeneration]] and [[concepts/player/game\|games]] as responses to the [[concepts/design/metacrisis\|metacrisis]] - the uniquely challenging moment we're living in the history of our civilization, and

b) planting notes - exploring different [[ideas\|ideas]], [[resources\|resources]], [[pathways\|pathways]] to create [[thriving\|thriving]] societies, oriented towards supporting the [[concepts/alchemy/integral development\|integral development]] of individuals and our systems, instead of the one we have, based on [[concepts/design/moloch\|win-lose dynamics]] and [extractivist paradigms](https://civilizationemerging.com/new-economics-series-4/) that are [[debasing our ecological substrate\|debasing our ecological substrate]], promoting profound [[concepts/design/intimacy crisis\|psycho-spiritual alienation]] and leading us towards impeding [[topics/architect;design/civilizational collapse\|systemic collapse]].

> [!info]- more on the design/philosophy of this space
> > "a digital garden is something inbetween a personal blog and a wiki. it's a collection of evolving notes, essays, and ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date. they're inherently exploratory – posts are linked through contextual associations (bi-directional links). they aren't refined or complete - posts can be published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. they're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal "blogs" we're used to encountering on the web." - [[people/references/lab/maggie appleton\|maggie appleton]] on [digital gardening tools and resources](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners).
> 
> the digital garden [metaphor](https://maggieappleton.com/metaphors-web) can go a really long way. understanding your knowledge as a web of relationships can make us question, manage and design our [[information ecologies\|information ecologies]] in more conscious ways. you can read more about my perspectives on knowledge management/sharing on [[_000_digital garden/about - my approach to knowledge development\|about - my approach to knowledge development]] post.
> 
> keep in mind, the notes i tend to and share here are part of a *slow process of [[topics/alchemy/sensemaking\|sensemaking]] and [[knowledge-building\|knowledge-building]] about myself and the world.* many of them will be messy, unfinished, poorly formatted, but i still try to apply different [[patterns/pattern collections/knowledge design patterns\|knowledge design patterns]] to make them more easily [[terms/navigation\|navigatable]], as they're relevant/interesting enough that i want to share. :)

### ❔ how this space is structured

*notes in this garden have 3 growth stages:* #🌱 *(seedling),* #🌿 *(budding)* and #🌲 *(evergreen).*

there are two ways you can navigate this space:

1) 🗺 a structured, organized, narrative way, in which i share the foundational concepts, references, tools and discoveries of my research/learning/work.
2) 🕸 a loose, experimental, self-directed navigation on a topic-based index of notes, which is how the notes are planted in this space. (coming soon, an alternative navigation based on [[patterns/active patterns/knowledge design/relevance score\|relevance scores]] is available in the meantime)

choose your path below!

#### 1) 🗺 my research - structured way

> [!info]- intro to the research

> 
> *a.k.a. how can we develop systems and structures to support life thriving on earth?*
> 
> > **2) how can we make life more like a sacred [[concepts/player/game\|game]]?**
> 
> *a sacred game is not any kind of game.* it's one that's deeply *fun, collaborative, challenging, meaningful* and *fulfilling*.
> a game that honors the beauty and mystery of life, that challenges and supports us to flourish - to discover ourselves, unfold our potentials and share our gifts with others.
>
>some people have a resistance with the [[concepts/player/game\|game]] frame because of its often seen competitive, game-theoretical win-lose dynamics. i share that hesitation, in the normal sense of the term. that's why the concept of game i'm using here is closer to the [[concepts/design/infinite games\|infinite game]] and [[omni-win dynamics\|omni-win dynamics]] observed by thinkers such as [[projects & tools/projects/player/world game\|buckminster fuller in the world game]] and communities such as [[models & frameworks/player/fourgames\|fourgames]], [[initiatives, orgs & communities/architect;design/metagame.wtf\|metagame.wtf]] and [[projects & tools/projects/player/startover.xyz\|startover.xyz]].
>
> **why not just "play" then?**
> 
> because games introduce the distinction of [[concepts/player/serious play\|serious play]]. a game can be a container in which you feel like you truly "gave it your best" - it may be an epic journey in which you thrive and learn/gather feedback from that - or you can also fail miserably and learn a bunch of other lessons from that. it provides a context for a profound, immediate, experiential form of learning, since you have a very tight application of the [[models & frameworks/design/OODA loop\|OODA loop]].

my aim here isn't to provide definitive answers, but starting points. my hope if for this curation to serve as an overview, to give us some clarity of the territory and empower us as [[sensemakers\|sensemakers]] and infinite [[players\|players]]. so we can start playing these [[metagames\|metagames]] more consciously, easily and collaboratively.

#### relevance score visualizations

i still have to figure out why the [digital garden plugin](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/) i'm using isn't allowing me to show the relevance score property on my notes. i currently have 75 notes with assigned relevance scores over 80, and i'm slowly adding it to more and more of them (mostly [[terms/design\|design]]/[[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss1us.design\|architect]] & [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss1us.lab\|lab]] notes were tagged so far, so the index below is missing a ton of stuff from [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss1us.alchemy\|alchemy]], [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss.art\|art]], [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss1us.player\|player]] and [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss1us.regen\|regen]], that are less processed/more embrionary).

i intend to fix this soon, but in the meantime, while i'm also building the [[_001_MOCs/025 🔷 long game/025 🗺 topics & references MOC\|025 🗺 topics & references MOC]] and [[_003_research/00 - viable pathways book-zine\|viable pathways]]' [[_003_research/05 - core references & resources\|05 - core references & resources]] pages, this is a useful visualization for navigating this research garden by identifying what i deem as most relevant from the areas above:

\**i've hid anything below 80 relevance score since - well, they're not as relevant at the moment, and therefore shouldn't clutter this visualization.*

##### how do I make my own garden?

i edit this using obsidian, a note-taking software that i use for my [second brain](https://maggieappleton.com/basb). you can start using the app by downloading it for free at [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md). there are many tutorials and possible advanced setups, but for starters, i recommend nick milo's ["obsidian for beginners" youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3NaIVgSlAVLHty1-NuvPa9V0b0UwbzBd) and his [LYT obsidian toolkit](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/_Start+Here).

to host my notes, i use the [obsidian digital garden plugin](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/) . it's quite easy to setup. but you can also pay for obsidian publish for a simpler, less technical setup.

##### how can i be in the loop for new content/updates on these projects?

sign up for my [newsletter](https://c4ss1us.substack.com/). also, if you want to be even more 'in the know', one possibility is to join a whatsapp group i created, in which i only occasionally share updates and exchange with a small group of friends. i'm leaving it open for new co-conspirators as well right now, as a way to approximate our relationship if you really feel the resonance. ❤ ask me about it on [telegram](https://t.me/c4ss1us).
