## hello! welcome to my digital garden! 🌷

this is a space comprised of 2 main parts:

1) publishing my structured [[topics/architect;design/research\|research]]/[[tbprocessed/base notes/concepts - general/curation\|curation]] on the [[concepts/design/metacrisis\|metacrisis]] - i.e. the set of inter-unfolding crises that underline the current moment we're living in the history of human civilizations, and

2) my own developments & propositions integrating these references - especially in the fields of  [[concepts/alchemy/consciousness development\|consciousness development]], [[terms/design\|design]], [[topics/architect;design/technology\|technology]], [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss.art\|art]], [[topics/regen/earth regeneration\|regeneration]] and [[concepts/player/game\|games]] as systemic responses to the metacrisis.

you'll also find loose notes - exploring different [[ideas\|ideas]], [[resources\|resources]], [[pathways\|pathways]] to create [[concepts/alchemy/thriving\|thriving]] societies, oriented towards supporting the [[concepts/alchemy/integral development\|integral development]] of individuals and our [[topics/architect;design/systems\|systems]], instead of our dominant ones, based on [win-lose dynamics](https://civilizationemerging.com/new-economics-series-3/) and [extractivist paradigms](https://civilizationemerging.com/new-economics-series-4/) that are destroying the planetary systems we depend upon, promoting profound [[diagnosis/intimacy crisis\|psycho-spiritual alienation]] and leading us towards impeding [[topics/architect;design/systemic collapse\|systemic collapse]].

*⚠ note: this garden is under intense development! most notes are works-in-progress and may have a few disconnected phrases, references and links scattered throughout. explore at your own risk or come back in a few weeks/months when they're more mature! :)*

> [!info]- more on the design/philosophy of this space
> > "a digital garden is something inbetween a personal blog and a wiki. it's a collection of evolving notes, essays, and ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date. they're inherently exploratory – posts are linked through contextual associations (bi-directional links). they aren't refined or complete - posts can be published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. they're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal "blogs" we're used to encountering on the web." - [[people/references/lab/maggie appleton\|maggie appleton]] on [digital gardening tools and resources](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners).
> 
> the digital garden [metaphor](https://maggieappleton.com/metaphors-web) can go a really long way. understanding your knowledge as a web of relationships can make us question, manage and design our [[information ecologies\|information ecologies]] in more conscious ways. soon you'll be able to read more about my perspectives on knowledge management/sharing on [[_000_digital garden/about - my approach to knowledge development\|about - my approach to knowledge development]] post.

### ❔ how this space is structured

*notes in this garden have 3 growth stages:* #🌱 *(seedling),* #🌿 *(budding)* and #🌲 *(evergreen).*

there are two ways you can navigate this space:

1) 🗺 a structured, organized, narrative way, in which i share the foundational concepts, references, tools and discoveries of my research/learning/work. (*still very early stage! i recommend you follow the second option, below.*)
2) 🕸 a loose, experimental, self-directed navigation on a topic-based index of notes, which is how the notes are planted in this space.

choose your path below!

#### 1) 🗺 my r&d - structured way

> [!info]- intro to the research
>  
> the goal of my research was to map, understand and curate multiple cohesive approaches and possibilities to answer the question:

>
> i.e. how can we address the interconnected [[inner\|inner]] and [[outer\|outer]] dimensions of the [[concepts/design/metacrisis\|metacrisis]]?
>
> by sharing my findings, i aim to establish some foundational [[topics/architect;design/knowledge commons\|knowledge commons]] to support us in navigating this complexity and enabling new, more [[resilient\|resilient]], [[regenerative\|regenerative]] [[topics/architect;design/systems\|systems]], [[_004_L1F3/core concepts/lifestyles\|lifestyles]] and [[concepts/alchemy/ways of being\|ways of being]].

> 
> *a.k.a. how can we develop systems and structures to support life thriving on earth?*
> 
> this comprises most of the "research" part of this work. most pages will be tagged with #alchemy or #design tags.
> 
> > **b) how can we make life more like a sacred [[concepts/player/game\|game]]?**
> 
> *a sacred game is not any kind of game.* it's one that's deeply *fun, collaborative, challenging, meaningful* and *fulfilling*.
> a game that honors the beauty and mystery of life, that challenges and supports us to flourish - to discover ourselves, unfold our potentials and share our gifts with others.
> 
> this comprises most of the "development" part of this work. most pages will be tagged with #lab, #regen  or #player tags.
> 
> some people have a resistance with the [[concepts/player/game\|game]] frame because of its often seen competitive, game-theoretical win-lose dynamics. i share that hesitation, in the normal sense of the term. that's why the concept of game i'm using here is closer to the [[concepts/design/infinite games\|infinite game]] and [[omni-win dynamics\|omni-win dynamics]] observed by thinkers such as [[projects & tools/projects/player/world game\|buckminster fuller in the world game]] and communities such as [[models & frameworks/player/fourgames\|fourgames]], [[initiatives, orgs & communities/architect;design/metagame.wtf\|metagame.wtf]] and [[projects & tools/projects/player/startover.xyz\|startover.xyz]].
>
> **why not just "play" then?**
> 
> because games introduce the distinction of [[concepts/player/serious play\|serious play]]. a game can be a container in which you feel like you truly "gave it your best" - it may be an epic journey in which you thrive and learn/gather feedback from that - or you can also fail miserably and learn a bunch of other lessons from that. it provides a context for a profound, immediate, experiential form of learning, since you have a very tight application of the [[models & frameworks/design/OODA loop\|OODA loop]].

#### relevance score visualizations

i still have to figure out why the [digital garden plugin](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/) i'm using isn't allowing me to show the relevance score property on my notes. i currently have 131 notes with assigned relevance scores over 80 (max 100), and i'm slowly adding it to more and more of them (mostly [[terms/design\|design]] & [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss1us.lab\|lab]] notes were tagged so far, so the index below is missing a ton of stuff from [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss1us.alchemy\|alchemy]], [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss.art\|art]], [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss1us.player\|player]] and [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss1us.regen\|regen]], that are less processed/more embryonary).

i intend to fix this soon, but in the meantime, while i'm also building other views to help navigate this information - the [[_001_MOCs/025 🔷 long game/025 🗺 topics & references MOC\|025 🗺 topics & references MOC]] and [[_003_research/00 - viable pathways book-zine\|viable pathways]]' [[_003_research/05 - core references & resources\|05 - core references & resources]] pages - this is a useful visualization for navigating this research garden by identifying what i deem as most relevant from the areas above:

\**i've hid anything below 80 relevance score since - well, they're not as relevant at the moment, and therefore shouldn't clutter this visualization.*

#### additional information

##### how do I make my own garden?

i edit this using obsidian, a note-taking software that i use for my [second brain](https://maggieappleton.com/basb). you can start using the app by downloading it for free at [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md). there are many tutorials and possible advanced setups, but for starters, i recommend nick milo's ["obsidian for beginners" youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3NaIVgSlAVLHty1-NuvPa9V0b0UwbzBd) and his [LYT obsidian toolkit](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/_Start+Here).

to host my notes, i use the [obsidian digital garden plugin](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/) . it's quite easy to setup. but you can also pay for obsidian publish for a simpler setup.

##### how can i be in the loop for new content/updates on these projects?

sign up for my [newsletter](https://c4ss1us.substack.com/). also, if you want to be even more 'in the know', one possibility is to join a whatsapp group i created, in which i only occasionally share updates and exchange with a small group of friends. i'm leaving it open for new co-conspirators as well right now, as a way to approximate our relationship if you really feel the resonance. ❤ ask me about it on [telegram](https://t.me/c4ss1us).
