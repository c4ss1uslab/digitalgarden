this is a playful, very low-fidelity artsy [[responses/lab/knowledge visualization\|knowledge visualization]] experiment - i wanted to visualize what the topology of my [[_000_digital garden/c4ss1us' garden\|digital garden]] sort of looked like.

inspired by:
https://tomcritchlow.com/map/
https://hermitage.utsob.me/
https://diagram.website/
[[models & frameworks/wardley mapping\|wardley mapping]] and the concept of [[information ecologies\|information ecologies]].

i intend to make this eventually as a procedurally-generated (constantly updating) map, sourcing data from my [[obsidian vault\|obsidian vault]], but using something like [[projects & tools/tools/lab/juggl\|juggl]], [[infranodus\|infranodus]], or some kind of [[references/lab/map-making tools\|map-making tool]].

this way you can have a glimpse at the major "[[knowledge ecosystems\|knowledge ecosystems]]" being tended to and have a big picture view to help you navigate this content.

another option would be to filter by more conventional [[topics\|topics]]/[[tags\|tags]] that can help you navigate (see below).

##### phase 1:

                                       ~ *under construction, clickable soon* ~

shows: topics, content, sources (relationships & weights for each: resonance, practical relevance, stage/readiness)

##### phase 2:
