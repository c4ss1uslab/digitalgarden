### why

when you land somewhere new, what feeling does that place bring to you?

on most of the text-centric internet websites, i found a sense of exhaustion. not to romanticize the 2000's creative personal websites (that are indeed fun!), but also caring for [[accessibility\|ease of use]], [[topics/lab/information design\|information design]] and [[data storage\|data storage]]. the few modern websites that i really like (found by spending hundreds of hours doing research) still only brought me a sense of surprise, excitement or interest. *delight, relief, a sense of home* are a different thing. they're hard to come by. much harder to craft, especially already inside of the context of modern [[browsers\|browsers]] and [[data siloes\|data siloes]].

many amazing ideas that i know i'd love to know are stuck in dry academic papers, without taking advantage of the [[dynamic medium\|dynamic medium]] we find ourselves in. something like [[projects & tools/tools/lab/open knowledge maps\|open knowledge maps]] indeed can support the discovery, but many of [[people/references/lab/francis miller\|francis miller]]'s principles for [[topics/lab/information design\|information design]] and presentation for example are still far from implemented. and [[topics/lab/large language models\|LLMs]] are obviously still very limited (and text-centric).

so when you land on my garden, what do i hope you feel?

both a sense of excitement, fun, discovery, as well as calmness and a recognition of the territory/possible journeys ahead of you.

### the map

this is a playful, very low-fidelity artsy [[topics/lab/knowledge visualization\|knowledge visualization]] experiment that i started as i wanted to visualize what the topology of my [[_000_digital garden/c4ss1us' garden\|digital garden]] looked like. the data isn't factual (yet).

inspired by:
https://tomcritchlow.com/map/
https://hermitage.utsob.me/
https://diagram.website/
https://x.com/poetengineer__/status/1870928855017705850
[[models & frameworks/design/wardley mapping\|wardley mapping]] and the concept of [[information ecologies\|information ecologies]].

i intend to make this eventually as a procedurally-generated (constantly updating) map, sourcing data from my [[obsidian vault\|obsidian vault]], but using something like [[projects & tools/tools/lab/juggl\|juggl]], [[infranodus\|infranodus]], or some kind of [[references/lab/map-making tools\|map-making tool]].

this way you can have a glimpse at the [[concepts/design/knowledge ecology\|knowledge ecology]] being tended to here and have a big picture view to help you navigate this content.

another option would be to filter by more conventional [[topics\|topics]]/[[tags\|tags]] that can help you navigate (see below).

#### topic-based map
##### phase 1:

                                       ~ *under construction, clickable soon* ~

shows: topics, content, sources (relationships & weights for each: resonance, practical relevance, stage/readiness)

##### phase 2:
