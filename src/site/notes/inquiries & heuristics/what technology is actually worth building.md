this subject can be highly emotionally challenging, especially if you're someone very idealistic or if you have worked on/cultivated a specific vision of desirable technology for a long time. i link to several resources that can make navigating the multitude of perspectives on the topic a little easier and more nuanced, but i suggest you take it slow and with an open heart.

##### the technologist ethos

there are fundamental issues with how most tech is designed today (alienation, polarization, centralization of profits/externalization of costs, distraction, etc - and many people are aware of it), but several of these issues are also pervasive in many "[[tech for good\|tech for good]]" initiatives.

"good for whom?" might one say. just like many of the "benefits" of [[concepts/design/modernity\|modernity]]/industrialization, how aware are we of the systemic impacts/consequences of such "good", especially on others who might not be benefiting as much from it? how much are we invested in really understanding it? in the dominant "move fast and break things", or even in the philanthropic shallow impact metrics culture, not much.[Â¹](https://consilienceproject.org/technology-is-not-values-neutral-ending-the-reign-of-nihilistic-design-2/)

if we understand the extent of the [[concepts/design/metacrisis\|metacrisis]] and how most technology today is accelerating the rate of [[concepts/design/existential risk\|existential]] and [[terms/catastrophic risk\|catastrophic risks]], it's sufficiently scary to make us question: what does [[mature\|mature]], [[concepts/alchemy/wisdom\|wise]] technology look like?

there's also a lot more talk today about [[AI alignment\|AI alignment]] and [[values alignment\|values alignment]], but not much alignment amongst humans themselves on what [[concepts/alchemy/values\|values]] are, really? academic conversations on [[ethics\|ethics]] and [[topics/alchemy/metaphysics\|metaphysics]] also suffer from [[academic biases\|academic biases]], often not dialoguing with other [[_001_MOCs/025 ðŸ”· long game/025 ðŸ—º topics & references MOC\|fields of knowledge]], [[epistemologies\|epistemologies]], [[concepts/alchemy/ways of knowing\|ways of knowing]], [[topics/alchemy/spiritual lineages\|wisdom traditions]], etc...

the [[_010_notes from courses, events & chats/technological metamodernism\|technological metamodernism]] course notes do a great job of introducing a few key lesser known perspectives, such as [[axiological design\|axiological design]], powerful research on [[concepts/alchemy/values\|values]], a few philosophical cornerstones of [[responses/alchemy/metamodernism\|metamodernism]], and many resources that i'll often refer to for further understanding/navigating the dominant [[concepts/design/memetics\|memetics]]/[[narratives\|narratives]] in both mainstream and smaller tech sub-cultures (the [[_009_notes & highlights from books, videos, articles/listening society\|listening society]] book as a whole introduces essential distinctions for any technologist/designer/politician \[or any human, really], but that can be challenging to navigate).

[[projects & tools/projects/design/diome.xyz\|diome.xyz]]'s research also presents several key frames that both clarify the underlying dynamics of our [[human predicament\|human predicament]] and explores what are emergent approaches to developing technology for a [[regenerative society\|regenerative society]], going beyond just "[[initiatives, orgs & communities/lab/center for humane technology\|humane tech]]".

i recommend spending a good amount of time digesting these references, as they've been very transformative for me (it's been 5 years brewing and changing things on the inside)...

also, a relevant and more accessible introduction for people completely new to these perspectives is: [[people/references/lab/bret victor\|bret victor]]'s [[_009_notes & highlights from books, videos, articles/What can a technologist do about climate change\|What can a technologist do about climate change]]? (which focuses on climate, but the reflections he brings are much more applicable than that)

finally, a couple **huge** [[blindspots\|blindspots]] not just from the tech scene, but most humans alive today are the [[diagnosis/energy crisis\|energy crisis]] and [[diagnosis/self-terminating economic system\|self-terminating economic system]] we're living in, which logically lead to the necessity of [[degrowth\|degrowth]], as explained by [[diagnosis/systemic collapse\|systemic collapse]] and [[responses/lab/permacomputing\|permacomputing]].

##### so, after some time exploring all that, what's worth building?

for me, in short, it's: [[regenerative systems\|regenerative systems]] & tools for [[_004_L1F3/core concepts/self-management\|self-management]], [[topics/design/coordination systems\|coordination]] and [[topics/design/collaboration tools\|collaboration]] (so we can create [[concepts/alchemy/thriving\|thriving]] societies).

now, the answer of what's worth building "**now***" is a lot more challenging after we've gone through the philosophical bump. for me, what's worth building "now" depends on a blend of your [[unique self\|unique self]] expression (what's *yours* to do) and [[strategy\|strategy]]/[[situational intelligence\|situational intelligence]] (what's *feasible* now).

a few frames that orient me in this space and might also help:

- systems for more conscious [[topics/player/learning\|learning]], [[_004_L1F3/core concepts/lifestyles\|living]] and [[terms/collaboration\|collaborating]].
- systems that extend/improve our [[models & frameworks/design/OODA loop\|OODA loop]] - i.e. our meta-cognitive processes of [[models & frameworks/design/OODA loop\|sensing, sensemaking, decision-making, action, learning]].

```

there are some people like [[fifty years\|fifty years]],[[ OS fund\| OS fund]] and futures-oriented funds focused on long-term civilization-altering tech like [[topics/lab/artificial intelligence\|AI]], [[GNR\|GNR]] (genetics, nanotech, robotics) and [[deeptech\|deeptech]] in general.

there are others like [[betaworks\|betaworks]], [[initiatives, orgs & communities/design/gitcoin\|gitcoin]]/[[giveth\|giveth]], [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1usâ€™ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/archive/databases/organizations master list/huggingface\|huggingface]] and [[initiatives, orgs & communities/design/protocol labs\|protocol labs]], who are supporting many initiatives taking the open-source, modular approach, which have more transformative effects in the present. i have my doubts about how far they can go in their purpose of "fixing the internet", without a deeper architectural intervention such as holochain/synapsis, but nonetheless i see them as valid attempts at improving our current state of things and creating alternatives to our centralized dominant systems. (somewhat like web 2.5 applications)

if these initiatives can work in a similar way to [[initiatives, orgs & communities/design/SEEDS (ecosystem)\|SEEDS]], which don't pose to be the final solution (create the next 'regenerative worldcoin'), but are very aware of the self-terminating crises we're in and aim therefore to provide viable transition paths (tools for enabling regenerative economies), i think that's a fair and important attempt, to have truly functional alternatives to our exponentially growing degenerative systems.

though i must say i never really took the time to understand the depth and limitations of [[projects & tools/tools/design/IPFS\|IPFS]]/[[filecoin\|filecoin]], so that's a big knowledge gap on my end (that i intend to solve soon).

[[we are here to - learn, create, heal, share and play\|we are here to - learn, create, heal, share and play]]

regenerative systems also imply this holistic (4d) view, but this isn't always the case. we can regenerate the earth at the expense of degenerating some relationships, for example. so i think a challenging yet good frame here is [[_004_L1F3/l1f3 protocol\|coordination across paradigms]].

which aspects of life is this (supposedly) regenerative game really regenerating?

given this context, a few frames on what's worth building for me:



default modes of being: learn, create, heal, share, play

*metrics v1*: awareness, clarity, effectiveness, efficiency, fulfillment?
*metrics v2:* regenerative, collaborative, 

tech game dynamics:
-> automation, augmentation, optimization
