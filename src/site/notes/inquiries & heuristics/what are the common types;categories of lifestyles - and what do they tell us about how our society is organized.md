##### very early thoughts:

there are a LOT of "common lifestyles" or common characteristics of lifestyles that we're familiar with.

here's an attempt at a simple classification:

high-tech / low-tech
hyperconnected / local
fast-paced / slow
planned / spontaneous

high-cost / low-cost
transient / stationary
individual / communitarian
centralized / decentralized

types of lifestyles:
[[digital nomad\|digital nomad]], [[volunteering\|volunteering]], [[sailboat\|sailboat]]...

###### how can we classify the different types/stages of people and how can that help us clarify it?

on type: [[laggard\|laggard]] / [[innovator\|innovator]] (distribution curve), archetype ([[models & frameworks/alchemy/12 archetypes\|models & frameworks/alchemy/12 archetypes]]) ...
on stage: [[life stage\|life stage]] (both age and moment/priority), [[concepts/alchemy/consciousness development\|consciousness development]] stage.

###### how some other people think about it:

[[people/references/regen/vanessa andreotti\|vanessa andreotti]] points out the systemic erasing of indigenous [[concepts/alchemy/ways of being\|ways of being]] and lifestyle possibilities outside of the [[house of modernity\|house of modernity]].

[[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1usâ€™ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/archive/databases/sub-missions list/disruptive life OS v. 1.0/disruptive os breakdown/personal ecosystems creation/intrapersonal management/learning-education resources/alternative education companies database/roote\|roote]] refers to "ambitious frontier people".
[[initiatives, orgs & communities/alchemy/possibility management\|possibility management]] refers as to a similar group as "[[edgewalkers\|edgewalkers]]".
[[people/references/alchemy/hanzi freinacht\|hanzi freinacht]] evidences a growing number of people, also in this group, as members of the [[precariat\|precariat]].

it's also part of the common imaginary the views of:
a) [[artists\|artists]] waiting tables to make ends meet while they strive for a career in art.
b) the [[entrepreneur\|entrepreneur]] bootstrapping their business in a garage/family basement.
