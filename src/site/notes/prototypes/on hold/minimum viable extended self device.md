#### the idea

the original idea for this prototype came at the [[practices/música do círculo\|música do círculo]] retreat in jun/2023. i was surrounded by amazing artists and people in general, yet many of our conversations tended towards triviality.

i wondered - instead of making a lot of effort trying to gear the conversation towards more generative places - *how could i make connecting with people, learning and sharing about our lives more playful, fun, seamless?*

there are many [[human connection games\|human connection games]], [[facilitation tools\|facilitation tools]] and other [[topics/architect;design/serious games\|serious games]] that intend to do that, but i never felt fond of most of them. they felt too deterministic in guiding the conversations (though i definitely need to research more. if you know good ones, please lmk!). i was looking for something more open-ended.

the idea i arrived at after some time was to build a minimalistic [[extended self\|extended self]] device.

we augment ourselves all the time through the [[topics/architect;design/technology\|technology]] and [[clothes\|clothes]] we use. one feature i find fascinating about clothes (and their tech mix - [[wearables\|wearables]]) is how they can tell something about our selves/personality, pretty much instantly.

the idea is creating a medium that's a hybrid of physical (sensorially meaningful) and digital (updateable) - the simplest version possible of a device for displaying/interacting with digital information/functions in-person in a simple fashion.

this device introduces different creative dynamics ([[curiosity\|curiosity]], [[experimentation\|experimentation]], [[higher dimensionality\|higher dimensionality]]) caused by its technological design/constraints, while also reducing our reliability on smartphones/tablets (two-dimensional ways of sharing information) on social interactions.

picture something like an interactive [[topics/architect;design/zines\|zines]] w/ embedded LCD screen(s).

i'm still very open when it comes to the [[user interface 1\|interface]] / [[user experience 1\|UX]], but i'm looking for something that leverages the spatial/tactile features of physicality.

for the mvp, i'm considering between using a: [[raspberry pi\|raspberry pi]], [[arduino\|arduino]], an [[e-ink device\|e-ink device]], [chromebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qfSJxcgH5I&pp=ygUbcmFzcGJlcnJ5IHBpIGlzIGZvciBwYXlwaWdz) or [other single board computers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJvCVw1yONQ).

#### development

*march/2024 update:*

i signed up for an 8-week course at [[SESC santana\|SESC santana]] on [[circuitpy\|circuitpy]] and [[raspberry pi pico\|raspberry pi pico]], and it seems like a great beginner-friendly setup. i'll be learning about it and experimenting with building this prototype there.

*july/2024 update:*

after i learned some basics of [[electronics\|electronics]] and [[circuitpy\|circuitpy]]/[[raspberry pi pico\|pi pico]] from the course, i decided to not focus on it n ow, as i realized publishing my [[_003_research/00 - viable pathways book-zine\|viable pathways book-zine]] my n° 1 priority.

it's still something i really wanna do in the mid-term (2-3 years max).
