inspired by the [[integral dashboard.jpg]], [[RPG\|RPG]]s, [[sword art online\|sword art online]], [[solo leveling\|solo leveling]]'s simple [[solo leveling UIs\|UIs]], and [[game interfaces\|game interfaces]] in general, i've been experimenting with creating a dashboard for [[self-management\|self-management]] for a long time.

i was never able to prioritize it, so it's still an unfinished [[_000_MOCs/070 🔩 prototypes MOC\|prototype]], but it's still a core mechanism of the [[_003_L1F3/L1F3 game\|L1F3 game]].

here's an overview of its development and current status:

##### phase 1 - 2020

at first i started using a simple yet beautiful UI on [figma](https://www.figma.com/file/5UpGleobC3WJFckn9BNA6U/c4ss1us'-l1f3-dashboard?type=design&mode=design&t=8W2QvUSxNCEwymnl-1), but started losing patience and ended up stopping v1 midway, to focus on just adding the information i found most relevant, without any wireframing (see phase 2).

##### phase 2 - 2022

##### phase 3 - 2023

after that, i could keep developing it/connect it to some data source/tracking mechanism, but i started feeling that it wasn't enough for it to be a dashboard dedicated only to self-management. i also wanted it to be a prototype for intentional spatial navigation across [[_000_MOCs/060 🗡 projects MOC\|projects]], [[_000_MOCs/025 🔷 long game/025 🗺 topics & references MOC\|topics]], [[areas/life areas (external)/communities (MOC)\|communities (MOC)]], etc. (information in general)

an interface that'd pull information from different sources and help you navigate it - [[youtube\|youtube]], [[tbprocessed/base notes/tools;products - general/notion\|notion]], [[tbprocessed/base notes/ventures - general/obsidian\|obsidian]], [[telegram\|telegram]], [[social media\|social media]], etc - in a user-centric and not platform-centric way.

despite all its back-end / API / interoperability challenges, i started researching how to do it and decided to design/prototype it as a different project, which i called the [[omnichannel curation feed\|📲 omnichannel curation feed]].

i started visually sketching it on figma as well, as you can see below.

![figma navigation dashboard 2 - relationships (raw draft).png](/img/user/images/made%20by%20me/figma%20navigation%20dashboard%202%20-%20relationships%20(raw%20draft).png)

today, it's more possible to make this "navigation dashboard"  within obsidian itself (it has the canvas function and the excalidraw plugin), but they're still not great for that (multiple cache/loading/GPU usage problems).

in a few months when [soft.space](https://soft.space) is more advanced, it may be better to continue building this there. [[fermat.ws\|fermat.ws]], [[kosmik\|kosmik]] and a few other [[spatial tools for thought\|spatial tools for thought]] also seem like viable alternatives.
