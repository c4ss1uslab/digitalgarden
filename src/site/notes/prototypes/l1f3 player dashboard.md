inspired by the [[integral dashboard.jpg]], [[RPG\|RPG]]s, [[sword art online\|sword art online]], [[solo leveling\|solo leveling]]'s simple [[solo leveling UIs\|UIs]], and [[game interfaces\|game interfaces]] in general, i've been experimenting with creating a dashboard for [[self-management\|self-management]] for a long time.

i was never able to prioritize it, so it's still an unfinished [[_000_MOCs/050 ðŸŸ© mid game/070 ðŸ”© prototypes MOC\|prototype]], but i still see it as a core mechanism of the [[l1f3 game\|L1F3 game]].

here's an overview of its development and current status:

##### phase 1 - 2020

at first i started using a simple yet beautiful UI on [[figma\|figma]], but started losing patience and ended up stopping v1 midway, to focus on just adding the information i found most relevant, without any wireframing (see phase 2).

##### phase 3 - 2023

after that, i could keep developing it/connect it to some data source/tracking mechanism, but i started feeling that it wasn't enough for it to be a dashboard dedicated only to self-management. i also wanted it to be a prototype for intentional spatial navigation across [[_000_MOCs/050 ðŸŸ© mid game/060 ðŸ—¡ projects MOC\|projects]], [[_000_MOCs/025 ðŸ”· long game/025 ðŸ—º topics & references MOC\|topics]], [[areas/life areas (external)/communities (MOC)\|communities (MOC)]], etc. (information in general)

an interface that'd pull information from different sources and help you navigate it - [[youtube\|youtube]], [[tbprocessed/base notes/tools;products - general/notion\|notion]], [[tbprocessed/base notes/ventures - general/obsidian\|obsidian]], [[telegram\|telegram]], [[social media\|social media]], etc - in a user-centric and not platform-centric way.

despite all its back-end / API / interoperability challenges, i started researching how to do it and decided to design/prototype it as a different project, which i called [[omnichannel curation feed\|ðŸ“² omnichannel curation feed]].

i started visually sketching it on figma as well, as you can see below.

today, it's more possible to make this "navigation dashboard"  within obsidian itself (it has the canvas function and the excalidraw plugin), but they're still not great for that (multiple cache/loading/GPU usage problems).

in a few months when [soft.space](https://soft.space) is more advanced, it may be better to continue building this there. [[fermat.ws\|fermat.ws]], [[kosmik\|kosmik]] and a few other [[spatial tools for thought\|spatial tools for thought]] also seem like viable alternatives.
