##### proto-sketches:

on [[_008_illustrations & designs/omnichannel curation feed sketch.excalidraw\|excalidraw]].
also on [figma](https://www.figma.com/file/5UpGleobC3WJFckn9BNA6U/c4ss1us'-l1f3-dashboard?type=design&mode=design&t=8W2QvUSxNCEwymnl-1).

##### experiments i ran:

scraping:
\+ tier 1 ([[references/lab/twitter lists\|twitter lists]], [[pockettube\|pockettube]], [[instagram profiles\|instagram profiles]])
\+ adding filters (highlight common followings + next: [[hive.one\|hive.one]] cross-ref)
next: integrate: "maps of ([[github\|github]], [[youtube\|youtube]], [[reddit\|reddit]], etc)"...

basic algorithm / display pre-set views:
- a la tweetdeck: top 10 most liked (twemex), liked by them, keywords (search filters)...
next: recommender system -> heavily weighted/controlled.

--> display on obsidian canvas.

i took the agent vs the API route.
