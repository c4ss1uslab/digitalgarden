potluck is a prototype made by kev, a friend i made at the [[coolab+dweb camp\|coolab+dweb camp]] in 2023. when he told me about it, i said "damn! that's pretty much the same vision i've been developing of a tool for effective and spontaneous [[resource allocation\|resource allocation]] within a [[initiatives, orgs & communities/architect;design/trust network\|trust network]]. i've been searching for this for over a year now! so glad i don't have to build it! 😂"

i'd love to have applied it within the [[initiatives, orgs & communities/player/MoL\|MoL]] [[practices/música do círculo\|música do círculo]]
