##### context

what lies ahead is a text introducing the context of systemic collapse from a deeply personal viewpoint. it will cite many academic and non-academic works, but ultimately it reflects how my ways of seeing and relating personally to this theme have been evolving over the past many years. it should be helpful/useful for anyone starting to (or already deeply) questioning the dominant [[civilizational systems\|civilizational systems]] of our society and wondering about hopeful/viable futures as we move forward.

##### an impeding systemic collapse?

many people realize that the way our (self-terminating) [[diagnosis/self-terminating economic system\|economic system]] works isn't sustainable. to put simply, "infinite growth isn't possible on a finite planet". we're effectively consuming all of the [[ecological substrate\|ecological substrate]] that we depend on and we're accelerating in that direction much faster than we're being able to turn it around - [[responses/regen/regenerative design\|regenerate]] it. and the modern, academic world has known it at least since the 60s. [[indigenous knowledge\|indigenous knowledge]], for much longer than that.

call it the [[concepts/design/metacrisis\|metacrisis]], [[anthropocene\|anthropocene]], [[concepts/design/polycrisis\|polycrisis]], [[wisdom gap\|wisdom gap]], all useful lenses for analyzing and relating to the state of the world, the possibility of creating a world uninhabitable not only for the humans, but most other terrestrial creatures is a possibility within our lifetimes, discussed everyday in these circles.

even if we talk about [[virtualization\|virtualization]] - i.e. how most of our lives/economies are becoming digital - a [[ready player one\|ready player one]] dystopic yet still romantic  kind of reality, our [GDP is still 99% correlated with energy use], and [97% with material production]. [[models & frameworks/design/sustainable development goals\|SDGs]], [[social change\|social change]] initiatives, diplomacy or [[_004_c4ss1us/c4ss1us.lab\|technology]] (very probably) won't magically solve the issues of [[diagnosis/accumulation, extraction, abstraction\|accumulation, extraction, abstraction]] (see also: [[concepts/design/moloch\|moloch]], [[inquiries & heuristics/what technology is actually worth building\|what technology is actually worth building]]).

and while there are many challenges and oppositions to alternative visions, such as [[degrowth\|degrowth]] or any type of [[systemic transition\|systemic transition]] really, many of us still feel called to grapple with this question and try to envision a [[models & frameworks/design/three horizons\|better future]] that's [[adjacent possible\|adjacent possible]].

it's a hard pill to swallow. one that once we really internalize, there's no unseeing it. and it becomes a responsibility not just to transform it for ourselves or the planet, but also towards the previous and next generations. it can be poetically, existentially and very practically seen as a civilizational [[rite of passage\|rite of passage]].

for the first time in human history, we have the first truly globally interconnected human society, with its own unique set of [[terms/catastrophic risk\|catastrophic]] and [[concepts/design/existential risk\|existential risks]] present today.

despite, or in addition to that, if we're not so short-sighted and narrow-minded, people have been learning from different sources, thinking, researching and prototyping around this for millenia.

[[people/references/design/daniel schmachtenberger\|daniel schmachtenberger]] and the folks researching the [[concepts/design/metacrisis\|metacrisis]] often refer to this possible event of a systemic collapse as a probable though not desirable outcome, and therefore striving to conjure up a [[third attractor\|third attractor]] - neither totalitarianism nor complete breakdown of the existing systems, as that [would badly hurt/kill a ton of people] - is a must.

the gist of the argument is:

> every major society in the history of our civilization has collapsed. and now we have a globalized one acceleratingly crossing [[planetary boundaries\|planetary boundaries]]. with [[win-lose dynamics\|win-lose dynamics]]/[[concepts/design/moloch\|molochian]] forces at work, it seems like we're in a very challenging trajectory that needs drastic change.

[[nate hagens\|nate hagens]] on [[concepts/design/the great simplification\|the great simplification]] puts it brilliantly on an [[energy consumption\|energy consumption]] and [[ecological overshoot\|ecological overshoot]] framing.

the book [[references/alchemy/first principles and first values\|first principles and first values - forty-two propositions on cosmoerotic humanism, the meta-crisis and the world to come]] is also a core reading, discussing it to a great degree.

a few great explorations on the subject from an [[concepts/design/infrastructure\|infrastructure]]/[[hardware\|hardware]] perspective as well: [XXIIVV â€” collapse](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/collapse.html),  [Collapse OS â€” Why?](http://collapseos.org/), [Collapse OSÂ â€” what makes collapse inevitable and imminent](http://collapseos.org/civ.html).

the more i read into it, the more likely this collapse seems. and while still having many caveats/attempting to hold back from [[doomerism\|doomerism]], it seems to me that:

**ultimately, whether we're going to collapse or not really doesn't matter much**.

(what? millions will die! billions will suffer!)

yes, that's definitely a huge problem that we want to avoid at (almost) all costs.

but the point isn't to speculate on whether or not we will collapse. if we will, probably there'll be no way to tell "hey, that specific person in the interior of taiwan was pointing all along to the critical piece of infrastructure that failed and was the tipping point of the system", or "that person in the xyz's person administration in the COP61 could've drastically changed the path we're collectively on right now".

have you tried taking a look at the landscape of potential [[terms/catastrophic risk\|catastrophic]] and [[concepts/design/existential risk\|existential risks]]? we can - and should - discuss [[_002_core notes/theories of change\|theories of change]], [[_005_MOCs/025 ðŸ”· long game/030 â›° challenges & framing MOC\|challenges]], [[topics/design/strategy\|strategies]], [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1usâ€™ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/archive/1 - on hold-waiting for/Porter's Generic Strategies - Choosing Your Route to Success/Untitled/Opportunities\|opportunities]] and the (thankfully) plethora of emergent [[_005_MOCs/050 ðŸŸ© mid game/055 ðŸ’¼ ventures & initiatives MOC\|initiatives]] and [[_005_MOCs/050 ðŸŸ© mid game/060 ðŸ—¡ projects MOC\|projects]] attempting to create [[_001_research/00 - viable pathways book-zine\|viable alternatives]] that allow us to sense, coordinate and unfold as an actual [[superorganism\|superorganism]].

even if our analysis is wrong once again and we don't collapse (which doesn't seem likely), **the transformation that needs to happen now and ongoingly**, is indeed about the dominant [[civilizational systems\|civilizational systems]] we're immersed in, but i'd argue - **even more so within us and among us on the path to get there**. in how our current [[_003_L1F3/core concepts/lifestyles\|lifestyles]] and [[concepts/alchemy/ways of being\|ways of being]] have become insanely wasteful, alienating, profoundly disconnected from nature and from ourselves. it's both a massive [[concepts/design/infrastructure\|infrastructural]]/[[ecological\|ecological]] crisis of global proportions, but also an equally, or even more pervasive, crisis of [[diagnosis/intimacy crisis\|intimacy]], [[morals\|morals]], [[inspiration\|inspiration]] and [[imagination\|imagination]].

we need to act on [[personal\|personal]], [[topics/design/local communities\|local]], [[regional\|regional]] and [[global\|global]] levels. find/craft our place(s) in the whole. collaboratively make sense of what's emerging in our realities and endeavor to cohere towards more beautiful processes/outcomes. increase our capacity to [[concepts/alchemy/waking up\|wake up]], [[concepts/alchemy/growing up\|grow up]], [[concepts/alchemy/cleaning up\|own up]], [[concepts/alchemy/opening up\|open up]], and [[concepts/alchemy/showing up\|show up]] in the world as the adults we'd like to have seen - or the [[ancestors\|ancestors]] that we'd like to be.

and this is a life-long journey.

wondering about whether systemic collapse can/will happen isn't something to be "right about", or to have some speculative mental masturbation exercise over a chat in the pub. that can also happen, but it misses the point. 

to put it simply, the [[right relationship\|right relationship]] to be in with life/nature isn't one of extraction and mindless consumption, but of respect and constant learning about the delicate web of impacts from our actions.

this conscious relationship with reality is what i want to work towards.

and we need to act/coordinate towards a [[systemic transition\|systemic transition]].
