"roote helps you clarify root-level systems to help humanity find our route. the fellowship is designed to bring ambitious frontier people together to connect and accelerate them on their path to impact on the wisdom age."

about: https://www.roote.co/fellowship

i participated in it during oct-nov 2023. i give it a 6/10 rating.

[the wisdom age](https://www.roote.co/wisdom-age) is a fantastic [[topics/architect;design/research\|research]]-synthesizing essay by them that made me want to engage deeper with [[roote\|roote]]. in 2022-23, they also were prototyping [[projects & tools/projects/lab/trails.social (ex-tweetscape)\|trails.social (ex-tweetscape)]], a very interesting tool for intentionally using [[projects & tools/tools/lab/twitter\|twitter]] for [[topics/architect;design/research\|research]] and [[concepts/alchemy/sensemaking\|sensemaking]].

i hoped the fellowship would go deeper into subjects such as the [[concepts/design/metacrisis\|metacrisis]], [[concepts/design/complex systems\|complex systems]], [[responses/alchemy/metamodernism\|metamodernism]] and discuss [[approaches\|approaches]]/propose [[experiments\|experiments]] as a [[community of practice\|community of practice]].

in practice, i found it to be more oriented towards helping young people interested in [[social impact\|social impact]] and [[self-development\|self-development]] find their way in life/work. something like [[moving up\|moving up]] and [[initiatives, orgs & communities/player/praxis\|praxis]] did for me back in 2016/17. the fellowship didn't go deep into these profound [[concepts/alchemy/sensemaking\|sensemaking]] topics i hoped for and i found [[people/references/architect;design/rhys lindmark\|rhys]]' perspectives often aligned with the [[effective accelerationism\|effective accelerationist]] meme, which disappointed me.

regardless of that, rhys is super generous, supportive, high-energy and a great writer. i find his articles great reminders/clear orientation devices on [[_004_L1F3/core concepts/life design\|life design]] and [[topics/architect;design/intentional tech\|intentional tech]]. most of the gold is available for free on [speedrunner's canon](https://www.roote.co/canon), i recommend going over it if you're in need of some guidance/principles/heuristics/order in your life.

also, feel free to explore any topics of interest in his posts, i've read a bunch and they're often great - https://www.rhyslindmark.com/all-posts/.

my notes going through it:

### my intentions/objectives

1. publishing research / experiments / prototypes → projects taking a life of their own
2. monetization pathways
3. friends who can exchange / bring new perspectives
4. co-conspirators / partnerships / co-creators

i.e. clarify/share projects, publish research, build network, get new opportunities.

-> a grande pergunta é:

1) o que eu quero publicar?
2) o que eu quero que aconteça/ter acesso no fim desse processo?

1) publicar:
- research (findings + references)
- prototypes
- experiments
- digital garden
- L1F3 project (+ next steps)

2) acesso a:
- pessoas que entendam/se conectem com os temas da pesquisa/desenvolvimento
(queiram trocar sobre, aprender, aprofundar, colaborar)
- estilo de vida em que eu consiga continuar aprendendo/aprofundando/criando de forma técnica
(fellowship, educational institution, research assistant role, algo do tipo)

#### gameplan:

program goals:

1) consolidate and publish my research, experiments & prototypes

on the metacrisis, systems design, psychotechnologies and meta-cognitive tools for more conscious, effective, fun and fulfilling learning, living and collaborating - into many different formats: articles, notion pages, obsidian pages, images.

breakdown:

a) my research & prototypes (into different mediums: articles, notion pages, obsidian pages, images)
- situational assessment
- references
- challenges
- opportunities
- projects
- possibilities
[l1f3 sharing methodology/structure]

b) "next steps" presentation:
- l1f3 as infrastructure for play (regenerative & evolutionary games) \\/ what's blocking us from creating/adopting such systems?
→ l1f3 as framework/toolkit for integrating and using:
- self-transformation pathways
	- startover
- coordination infrastructure
	- metagame / supermodular
- web3 infra
	- IPFS/holochain
- regenerative economies (eisenstein)
	- SEEDS
- vocational (a.k.a. creative)/shared/collaborative/multicurrencies economy systems/tools/practices
	- [[prototypes/made by others/potluck\|potluck]]
- - metaverse via personal tech stacks/setups (M3/OMI group)
	- FOSS
	- PKM/anytype
	- XR/softspace
	- AI
- etc...

2) connect/chat with:

3) apply to fellowships/grants/co-development (or apprenticeship/assistant roles)

###### goals & KPIs:

1) creation goals


KPIs:
- pieces of content worked on
- pieces of content consolidated
- pieces of content published

2) connection goals

3) learning goals

4) artistic development goals

→ last week:

- demo day (10 min? present what?)
- launch myself as a L1F3 player (fellowship / partnership / resources sharing / crowdfunding?)

#### roote projects:

weekly schedule:

- 60-min weekly call
- 3 30-min 1:1s?
- personal project development [1) project strategy, 2) focused project work, 3) sharing notes]
- weekly content

———————
#### roote reflections:

heuristics:

###### choose one thing
(simplify / how to operationalize based on the impact you wanna have)

if i need to choose 1 thing, it's L1F3.
launching l1f3 stream (as a community/ecosystem). mostly embodying the [[_002_toolkit/classes/architect\|architect]] archetype.

why L1F3: orienting ourselves towards developing both micro and macro-scale coordination/gameplay systems.

i.e. establishing rd.labs as a meta-guild.

for those interested in meta-systemic transformation.
(there are layers/levels of disruption. one may be earlier in the journey, focused on the personal first. that's fine. what's important is the interest/perspective in whole systems transformation)

meta-systems and tools for playing life in more conscious, effective, fun, collaborative and fulfilling ways, which support personal and systemic transition.

a hub for L1F3 players researching, developing and implementing the above.

###### simplify - simplify - simplify

reflection:
building this "player lifestyle" can be a step-by-step process.

in essence, my goal is to have a lifestyle that allows me to work on & learn deep technical skills (by building intentional/impactful projects), while having money/time/energy to take care of myself (go to the gym/do martial arts and go to music circles/activities).

- what can i start by offering?

###### how does pruning work? - developing intuition about natural systems

##### first week:

- [x] rdlabs group update ✅ 2023-10-03

##### open:

- how to work with me manual vs conv. menu + l1f3 player profile
- [ ] upgrade conversation menu
- [ ] consolidate l1f3 player profile
++ big five
++ MBTI - https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality / https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality
++ AQAL map (toggle: experiment / under construction)
++ journey / questions / challenges i'm living
++ projects i'm building
++ previous experiences (achievements/badges)
what if instead of linkedin, a fun/intentional/conscious way of presenting/showing yourself.
- references: [[metagame profile\|metagame profile]], [[pinterest\|pinterest]] (for ideas: [[sublime\|sublime]]/[[mln.ai\|mln.ai]]).

→ conv. menu as establishing vocabulary/wordcloud map of knowledge/interests/projects.

→ l1f3 player profile as an intro to the L1F3.GAME, life as play and projects as a whole.

- [ ] publish visual/spatial lab pages
	- [ ] builder
	- [ ] player
	- [ ] art

- consolidate into clearer views:

→ meta-systems view solving for:

- awareness/wisdom
- information/knowledge
- relationships/experiences
- resources/actions

→ agent-centric designs & recommendation systems:

- people / projects / organizations / institutions
- content
- topics
- events

##### core weeks:

###### consolidate & publish research:

for the past 4 years, i've been designing and living my life through the framework of an open-source human experiment. you can find all of my notes, references, findings and (soon) tracking data publicly available on my digital garden, which i believe can increase trust, collaboration and help you understand where this research is coming from.

###### structured view:
- context (metacrisis)
- questions & topics
- challenges & approaches
-> + initiatives still to be investigated
- micro challenges & opportunities
- findings & projects (OS → player system)
- experiments/prototypes

ps: this presentation format/structure comes from the [[_004_L1F3/l1f3 management ontology\|l1f3 management ontology]], an open-source, decentralized and modular approach to creating more conscious, effective, fun, fulfilling and collaborative realities & lifestyles.
