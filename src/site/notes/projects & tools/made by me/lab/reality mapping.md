**what are foundational ways we can map reality itself?**

a good way i found is through [[people/references/architect;design/andrea farias\|andrea farias]]' [[models & frameworks/design/holistic cultural materialism\|holistic cultural materialism]]:

##### superstructure

- [[cartographies of consciousness\|cartographies of consciousness]] / [[cartographies of mind\|cartographies of mind]]

##### physiologic structure

##### social structure

another good way of mapping is through:
##### 5 layers of mapping

from most collective to most individual:

- [[ecological maps\|ecological maps]] (hard physical & relationship boundaries)
- [[social maps\|social maps]] (what systems & entities exist "out there", what their designs are)
- [[narrative maps\|narrative maps]] (information and narratives created/shared as part of these systems & institutions)
- [[action maps\|action maps]] (where individuals and organizations are directing their resources)
- [[perspective maps\|perspective maps]] (what unique perspectives individuals are cultivating and proposing)
