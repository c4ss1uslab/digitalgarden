the world game was proposed by [[initiatives, orgs & communities/design/buckminster fuller institute\|buckminster fuller institute]] in the 1960s, aiming to:

> "make the world work, for 100% of humanity, in the shortest possible time, through spontaneous cooperation, without ecological offense or the disadvantage of anyone."

it is currently being stewarded by the [[initiatives, orgs & communities/regen/schumacher center for a new economics\|schumacher center for a new economics]].

it was both a workshop (finite game, [[concepts/design/magic circle\|magic circle]], a "play session") and an infinite game towards that objective, making it something extended and continually fed/played/integrated into people's lives via [[os.earth\|os.earth]].
