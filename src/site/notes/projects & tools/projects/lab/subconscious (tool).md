a project initiated by [[people/references/lab/gordon brander\|gordon brander]] that was discontinued in may/2024 as it failed to get traction and keep running sustainably.

it's an increeeedibly bold and interesting project though, with a lot of articles on its design/development available at https://newsletter.squishy.computer/.

bits and pieces of it will definitely come up/continue to be used for future projects/iterations in the [[topics/architect;design/tools for thought\|tools for thought]] space.
