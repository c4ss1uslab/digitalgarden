a discontinued yet very interesting prototype for an alternative [[twitter\|twitter]] feed made by a few folks at [[roote\|roote]].

recommended reading: https://www.roote.co/tweetscape/vision

their design was great, and they had fantastic write-ups on the whole design/development process. it was all hosted on a platform that got acquired by twitter and deactivated soon after, i couldn't salvage its contents. i still have hopes to get access to the blog posts / prototypes some time again.

their lead engineers were [[nick torba\|nick torba]] and [[julian fleck\|julian fleck]].
