##### about

a spiritual/self-knowledge tool that draws from the [[i-ching\|i-ching]], [[astrology\|astrology]], the [[kabbalah\|kabbalah]], [[vedic philosophy\|vedic philosophy]] and modern physics.

##### why it might be relevant, before showing a few examples

although i'm unsure about the value of the tool (since it goes into very wild territories), in terms of its design, human design provides a level of granularity of self-understanding/management that we don't often find in [[modern culture\|modern culture]]. this level of analysis can be very useful in the context of [[_004_L1F3/core concepts/life management\|life management]]/[[_004_L1F3/core concepts/self-management\|self-management]].

even deep [[topics/lab/quantified self\|quantified self]] setups don't have such broadness and depth of measuring/working with layers of [[inspiration\|inspiration]], [[ideas\|ideas]], [[terms/communication\|communication]], [[love\|love]], [[direction\|direction]], [[motivation\|motivation]], [[emotions\|emotions]], [[instinct\|instinct]], [[desires\|desires]] and [[pressure\|pressure]] - breaking down each of them into "understandable"/"measurable" units and practical directions that can orient one's [[_001_MOCs/075 🔴🟠🟡 short game/097 💭 thoughts MOC\|thoughts]]/[[_001_MOCs/075 🔴🟠🟡 short game/100 💪🏻 actions MOC\|actions]].

interesting examples are: [[energy type\|energy type]], [[authority center\|authority center]], [[life strategy\|life strategy]], [[manifestation process\|manifestation process]].

plus, the actual illustrations are cool.

similar to the [[concepts/alchemy/chakra\|chakras]] or [[ashtanga\|ashtanga]] in [[topics/alchemy/yoga\|yoga]], or [[buddhist\|buddhist]] [[paramitas\|paramitas]] / [[noble eightfold path\|noble eightfold path]], or (to my preference) [[responses/alchemy/metamodernism\|metamodern]] takes integrating these [[topics/alchemy/spiritual lineages\|spiritual traditions]] with evidence from [[psychology\|psychology]], [[cognitive science\|cognitive science]] and other fields, such as [[responses/alchemy/integral theory\|integral theory]]'s [[models & frameworks/alchemy/AQAL\|AQAL]] and [[people/references/alchemy/hanzi freinacht\|hanzi freinacht]]'s [[stage\|stage]], [[code\|code]], [[state\|state]] and [[depth\|depth]] model, these provide a way of seeing/relating to the complexity of being that can be very valuable guides on the path of [[self-unfoldment\|self-unfoldment]].
