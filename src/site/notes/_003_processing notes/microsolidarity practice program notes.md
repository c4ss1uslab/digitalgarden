i highly recommend you check out the [microsolidarity.cc](https://www.microsolidarity.cc/) website so you learn about what it is (watch the intro video and read the core essays) before you decide to keep going on this page. that's the best place to start. :)

❓How are you feeling?
❓Why did you join this Microsolidarity Practice Program? 
❓What do you hope to learn from this program?

🧭 5 mins per person, we'll send a message when it's time to switch

—————
intros:

martin (berlin) - organizational design. finding tribe that cares.

victor (san jose) - love it! metacrisis, vibecafe.xyz -> catalyze dyads, crew formation.

——————
3 layers of communication / 3 things we can talk about:

1. Information: about facts, data...
2. Personal: about feelings, values...
3. Interpersonal: about our relationship...

exercise -> observe (& follow) the sensor of aliveness/curiosity.

--> introduce yourself without talking about your job. talk about your real/deepest you (to the point you feel comfortable). feel the vibe. what amount of trust is there. how deep can we go?

——————
jelger (bergerac, france) - telegram

- emergence, biological systems, music, improv, facilitation, group dynamics. play to develop a realization of true value.

shockforest.group
life itself

-----------
parrot / paraphrase -> why do i loathe it?

(boring. assumes low level of presence/consciousness? activates a kind of focus/striving to prove myself/self-evaluation [school-like])

the guy from -> artem zen. psilocybin. rap.

❓What's going on for you right now? (Mentally, physically, emotionally, etc.)

🔍 Try giving voice to some of your different parts using the following sentence stems
""A part of me is feeling/thinking...""
""I notice one voice saying...""
""A part of me wants to...""

(Remember your curiosity and paraphrasing)

📝 Write some reflections in your own journal:

🔍 How did it feel today to be in the different groups? What did you notice about the different relational practices? What did you notice about yourself?

i wasn't in my 100% (sleep + coffee), but i still felt like i kind of matched the energy level of the group. so i feel that if i were in my 100%, i'd feel/be more connected, but at the same time, i'd feel a little disconnect in energy. as if maybe i was bringing too much energy/excitement that wasn't met by the group. (or maybe it'd be by some people, but not others).

i'm not sure what really makes us feel connected or not, even though we might have a lot of interests in common. e.g.: simon/christina from RF7.

it seems like something like openness/interest in the other's experiences. but it's a very subtle thing.

++ i appreciate the sharing of practices and light/fluid facilitation.

++ i really like the parts sharing. shows the complexity of the individual. and if clear that you're not looking for advice, create a deep context for connection (with deeper parts of our selves).
IFS -> unguarding into more warmth, compassion, heartful sharing.

other resonant shares:

"the "introduce myself without mentioning your job" exercise really helped me ease into a state of being myself rather than presenting myself."

"it felt so sweet and warm. each person is so full hearted and unguarded. i feel at ease."

“community begins with relationship”

"rapid mixing & connecting"

—————————

📝 "Homework"
- If this worked today, what made it work? 
- What can you bring back to your working group/home community?
- What is one small experiment you're willing to try now?

▶️ feel free to share on discord what you came up with!

#### session 2

(3-min journaling)
❓It's one year from today, you're in the best possible community/network/group. 
- What does it look like?

(15-min sharing)
After each sharing (3'), listening partners can reflect back (2') what they hear is important to the speaker, e.g. ideals, principles, values, desires, needs...

5' per person

the n° 1 thing is the people in the community being oriented around meta-systems transformation, not just random projects. 2nd being able to express the alchemy, architect, art, builder, player archetypes.

am i ready to start creating it? building it / doing it no matter what it takes, since it's gonna be worth it...

other people's shares:
artem - "being a leader"
jim - "16-person co-living community"

(2-min journaling)
❓What's blocking you from having the community that you want?

damn. i guess building it is just quite a challenging thing... requires coordination w/ people (on worldviews, values, communication) & money alignment. lots of complexity.

(4-min client sharing, 5 min consultant discussion [behind the scenes], 2 client sharing relfections]
[bts] = turning the camera/mic off.

hearing from my challenge:

consensus building challenges -> 6 people, who have more skin in the game.
meeting people is a strength. a way to go through blocks.

—————————

📝 Write some reflections in your journal about your experience today

🔍 How did it feel today to be Client and Consultant?
🔍 What was made possible in today's relational practices?

love to be in the space of the client. it's great to receive conscious, loving attention to our challenges.
being a consultant was also fun, as an opportunity to put our awareness/knowledge/strenghts to be available for others.

i was able to have a more firm ground in the direction of building the community i envision to be part of.

"beautiful structure. beautiful opportunity. it'll be different every time."
"we got into the details. and that's really lovely"
"it's really cool to hear what your friends have to say, while they clearly care"

"map of relational practices"

In your journal, what invitation could you make to another individual or small group to meet this need you have?

💭 How many people do you want to invite into this? 1 other, 2-4 others, ...
💭 Is there a practice that can be applied to your invitation to give it structure? Liberating structures, Troika, etc. 
💭 Do you want to invite an ongoing cadence (weekly, monthly, ...) or a one-time thing?

1) form a crew (up to 6 people) so we can as a group share how intend to and we're implementing these practices in our lives/communities.
2) map the possibilities - what needs/challenges do they address?
3) once a week, for 4 weeks. a 1-month experiment.

++ invite anyone in this call with more experience to say what's worked for them before.
