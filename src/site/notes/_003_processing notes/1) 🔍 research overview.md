##### tl;dr

this page is a compilation of the results and learnings of the experiment i've been running for the past ~5 years - designing and living my life as an open-source human, as well as establishing the foundational knowledge commons for the reality disruption labs (a metamodern guild for L1F3 players and life intelligence agency i've been co-creating).

##### intro
hello. for the past ~5 years i've dedicated my life to a metaphysical, epistemological and ontological research into "what is human flourishing and how can we enable it on both an individual and a societal scale", and of course, "what's my role in it".

i‚Äôm happy to share that since then, i've gained some clarity on this, as well as on missions i decided to work towards (might we collaborate on some of them? üôÉ). so this my compilation of the findings, resources and references i've found most valuable on this journey.

let's dive in!

------
#### motivation

the goal of this research is to curate and present multiple cohesive answers and possibilities to the question: **how do we create the more beautiful world our hearts know is possible?**

the two major concepts that underpin this research and can help us orient ourselves on this path are: the [[metacrisis\|metacrisis]] and the "[[well-lived life\|well-lived life]]".

‚ö† it is not required to be well-familiarized with these concepts to continue diving into this research, but if you take the time with it, it will give you much more depth, nuance and recognition of the territory moving forward, so i highly encourage you to do so.

i will introduce and present a few powerful perspectives + "investigation trails" on both concepts, as a way to contextualize the following contents and give you a direction for further exploration.

###### 1) the [[metacrisis\|metacrisis]].

we're living an age of the [[metacrisis\|metacrisis]].

our institutions and systems are failing us - [[governments\|governments]], [[organizations\|organizations]], [[academia\|academia]], [[religions\|religions]], [[social systems\|social systems]]. my research aims to map the challenges we're facing, identify the approaches being tested, underserved solutions and the initiatives working to address them, as way to give us a deeper and wider understanding of our context.

one peculiarity about this research is that since unhealthy individuals create unhealthy systems and institutions, i aim to highlight solutions and initiatives at both the individual and systems level.

this awareness can give us a sense of overwhelm or a possibility to redesign the foundational systems of our lives and civilizations to be more conscious, collaborative, regenerative, compassionate [insert another value you care about here] by design. perhaps both at the same time!

and it's our opportunity to be alchemists, architects, artists, builders of our realities.

if you're not familiar with the concept of the [[metacrisis\|metacrisis]], it's a term coined by a certain corner of the internet, sometimes called the "[[sensemaking web\|sensemaking web]]", "[[liminal web\|liminal web]]" or "[[tbprocessed/base notes/concepts - general/game b\|game b]]", heavily informed by the studies of [[wisdom traditions\|wisdom traditions]], [[transpersonal psychology\|transpersonal psychology]], [[integral theory\|integral theory]], [[metamodernism\|metamodernism]], [[game theory\|game theory]], [[cognitive science\|cognitive science]], [[systems\|systems]]/[[complexity science\|complexity science]] and a few other fields.

other adjacent terms and communities you might be familiar with are: the [[polycrisis\|polycrisis]] (coined by the world economic forum), the [[regenerative movement\|regenerative movement]], the [[human potential movement\|human potential movement]], [[effective altruism\|effective altruism]], [[mindfulness\|mindfulness]], the [[humane tech\|humane tech]] movement, the [[alternative education\|alternative education]] movement, [[effective accelerationism\|effective accelerationism]], [[web3\|web3]]...

for a deeper understanding of the "memetic tribes of the metacrisis", check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxHwkb35MkQ).

there are many resources and perspectives to help you dive into it, and although i'm aware that the '[[metacrisis\|metacrisis]]' is not a sexy/enticing term, it's through it that i found the most profoundly meaningful and cohesive analyses of our current situation, both as individuals and as a society at our time and age.

[[daniel schmachtenberger\|daniel schmachtenberger]] has been the primary spokesperson about it, and i highly, highly, highly recommend his videos - [curated playlist here].

besides daniel's work, the simplest, yet most clarifying perspectives i found came from [[zak stein\|zak stein]] and the [[transformative education alliance\|transformative education alliance]] on their essay "[education is the metacrisis](https://systems-souls-society.com/education-is-the-metacrisis/)".

for further breakdowns, [[john verveake\|john verveake]] also has a great series on [[meaning crisis\|awakening from the meaning crisis]], [[josh field\|josh field]] shares very unique perspectives on the [[flow crisis\|flow crisis]], and there's a lot more you can discover by browsing the [metacrisis.org](https://metacrisis.org/) website or looking at very disruptive metacrisis-informed projects such as [[tbprocessed/base notes/ventures - general/SEEDS\|SEEDS]] and [[tbprocessed/base notes/ventures - general/holochain\|holochain]] (both are deep in the web3 space, i don't recommend if you're a beginner).

the major value i found in attempting to diagnose and conceptualize our current state is to recognize and develop vocabulary over the systems dynamics that are constantly affecting us, so we can be more aware of them and empower ourselves to make better sense of what's going on and coordinate towards more desirable presents and futures.

after all, there's wisdom in the saying:

#### where to go now?

ok, so there's a wealth of perspectives on both the [[metacrisis\|metacrisis]] we're undergoing as a species, as well as the concept of a [[well-lived life\|well-lived life]], [[human potential\|human potential]] and [[how to live\|how to live]].

if we can agree on a few [[assumptions\|assumptions]], such as [[every perspective holds a part of the truth, it's not the truth itself\|every perspective holds a part of the truth, it's not the truth itself]], we can start to build a set of [[heuristics\|heuristics]] to inform our [[tbprocessed/base notes/concepts - general/sensemaking\|sensemaking]] and [[decision-making\|decision-making]] going forward.

instead of going the route of a herculean effort of synthesis on a "[[theory of everything\|theory of everything]]", such as [[an immanent metaphysics\|an immanent metaphysics]], (...) or [[integral theory\|integral theory]], that even though truly amazing and necessary (from my viewpoint), aren't accessible to the vast majority of people (right now), i'll opt for taking bits of wisdom here and there and trying to figure out - what are the minimum and easiest set of agreements that many people, holding different values and worldviews, can agree on, and how might we work from there?

this is my attempt to answer the question: what is the minimum set of agreements we need to allow for intelligent coordination?

#### why choose this route?

below under "go deeper", you can find all of the metaphysical, ontological and epistemological basis that i found through this research, and that currently compose my set of "minimum viable heuristics" for operating in life.

but it's not about that. this is an ongoing effort we all do in life, questioning, making sense of reality and clashing our perspectives against others.

i'm not presenting this to be "right" or to seem "wiser" than others.

so essentially the purpose of this work is to create an interoperability protocol for sensemaking and coordination at different levels.

#### "low hanging-fruit agreements"

i believe these are easy to agree on and they can lead to a powerful level of clarity and collaboration.

#### go deeper

they're below. feel free to explore them at different times, according to your own inquiries/curiosity. think of this pretty much like a glossary. if you find something in this research that clashes against your current worldview, you can dive deeper here to clean up any possible misunderstandings and understand what really makes sense for you.

###### fundamental questions:

initial questions:
- what is the purpose of life?
- what is reality?
- what is life?
- what is "truth"?
- what is "goodness"?
- what is "beauty"?

foundational questions:

- what does human flourishing mean? especially in this time-age?

- what does it take to build a society in which we thrive, as individuals and as a collective?

- how can we live our purpose, adventures & missions, at scale?

- what is abundance? how can we tap into it and distribute it?

- what does it mean to really "make the world work for 100% of humanity"?

- what are the fundamental tools and systems we have/interact with in our lives?

- what are the fundamental games we're playing, as humanity and as individuals?

second-order questions:
### principles & purpose

empower individuals and groups to develop sovereignty and agency.

### questions, topics & ideas

### foundational insights

### thesis

to address the metacrisis we need both individual efforts to design more [[conscious\|conscious]], [[nourishing\|nourishing]], [[collaborative\|collaborative]] and [[regenerative\|regenerative]] [[lifestyles\|lifestyles]], [[organizations\|organizations]], [[culture\|culture]] and [[communities\|communities]], as well as collective [[coordination\|coordination]] to create new [[governance\|governance]], [[economic\|economic]], [[information\|information]], [[organizational\|organizational]], [[educational\|educational]] systems that honors [[nature\|nature]] and people's [[energies\|energies]], [[purpose\|purpose]], [[expression\|expression]] and [[vocation\|vocation]] as sacred.

there are many people working on designing/building these new systems, making sense of our current state and addressing it from different perspectives. so my goal here is to:
1) present a map of the territory
2) share a few interpretation lenses/frameworks on how these efforts may be mutually supportive and integrated into a bigger whole
3) share my perspectives on the challenges that still remain and what we can do about them


### challenges being under-adressed

### opportunities not being seized

the innovation i see/propose:

[[highest leverage\|highest leverage]]:
- giving people the conditions to express their vocation / energy / potential. a life support network as a means to coordinate / collaborate / align ourselves towards personal evolution, world regeneration and catastrophic risk prevention.

doing this is not as hard as we might think. there's a lot of hanging fruits. we're just lacking intention/design.

++ improving the design/intentionality of our core technological systems:

#### next steps

i understood this research as an ongoing effort into understanding the foundational systems of our civilization and rebuilding them as open, distributed, collaborative and regenerative systems.

- why open?
just like openAI isn't really open, what do i mean here? voluntary, open-source, cooperative.

- why distributed?
resilience. living systems.

- why collaborative?
charles eisenstein sacred economics - actually needing each other. work that reconnects. reconnection. resilience.

- why regenerative?
