#### context/notes

this article is one to revisit often when thinking about [[metaphors\|metaphors]] and [[visual communication\|visual communication]]/[[illustration\|illustration]].

it's worth it to read it as a whole. my highlights below are most useful for my own personal use sometime in the future.

#### my highlights:

1)
> How do you draw a thing that's not a thing?
> 
> How do you take a fuzzy-edged, evolving cultural concept like “Web Security,” and condense it down to a single image?
> 
> The answer, in short, is a mix of cultural symbols and visual metaphor. Though there's a little more to it than that.

2)
> Good, meaningful illustration works in four layers. I like to think of it as a cake.

> You start with a solid base of visual metaphor. Add on a layer of clear, well-constructed drawing. Then you think about designing an aesthetically pleasing composition with [gestalt principles](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/03/design-principles-visual-perception-and-the-principles-of-gestalt/). And finally you throw fancy lighting and pretty colors over the top.

3)
> Metaphors are fundamental to how we visualise anything that's a non-physical, abstract **idea**.
>
> So, what's a Metaphor?
> 
> A metaphor is when we understand one thing in terms of another.
>
> The power of metaphor is it helps us use something we _know_ to understand something we _don't know_.
>
> Beyond just being useful for learning complex concepts, and framing old ideas in new ways, metaphor is the basis of nearly every thought we have. It's a fundamental building block of human cognition that shapes the way we perceive and interact with the world
