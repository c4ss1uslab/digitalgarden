> he shares a simple yet powerful framing of how we cannot afford as a society to continue with our businesses/governments/economies "as usual". there is and there can be no such thing as not being "mission-driven" (& i'd add: [[concepts/design/impact metrics\|wide-boundary]] oriented). we're always optimizing for some things at the expense of others, often unconsciously. we need to take this seriously and [end the reign of nihilistic design](https://consilienceproject.org/technology-is-not-values-neutral-ending-the-reign-of-nihilistic-design-2/). i urge you to read this and the article i just linked, deepening the analysis.
