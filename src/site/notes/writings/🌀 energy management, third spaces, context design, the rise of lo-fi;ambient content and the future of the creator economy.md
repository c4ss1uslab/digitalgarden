###### context:

my experience of the COVID-19 pandemics was 1 year longer than everyone else. when it struck, i was already on my 11th month isolated from the world.

i was going through some deep emotional healing processes, and found that my only way to cope was to read, meditate, research and ritualize. essentially, for ~3 years, i spent 95% of my time alone, in my room, learning about myself and the world, and rediscovering what moved me.

and this time in physical isolation made reflect and research a lot on the themes of [[belonging\|belonging]], the [[internet\|internet]], [[community building\|community building]] and [[memetic tribes\|memetic tribes]], especially related to the state and the potential of our [[information ecology\|information ecology]] and [[online communities\|online communities]].

in 2023, my life has been pretty much the opposite. going to ecovillages, farms, slums, courses, retreats and all sorts of cultural, local community events in sÃ£o paulo, brazil.

in this article, i aim to share my findings, curation and perspectives on the [[future of communities\|future of communities]] and the [[internet\|internet]] - and subjacent themes, such as the [[metaverse\|metaverse]], [[trust networks\|trust networks]] and a lot more.

i bring special attention to **[[intentional online communities\|intentional online communities]]** and **[[third spaces\|third spaces]]** as cultural [[attractors\|attractors]]. they're places that can feel more like home than at home or at work.

and how all of this is deeply related to the realizations i had about[[energy management\|energy management]] during this time in isolation.

##### intro

##### creator, curator & experience economies

###### unique potentials and challenges of in-person vs virtual communities

if there's something that persisted even after a lot of western influence and colonization (for its lights and shadows) in the global south culture is that we're a lot more communitarian. everyone is friends, everyone is family.

communities like [[mol\|mol]] and [[instituto amuta\|instituto amuta]] recognize this and are deliberately studying and practicing culture-building in more intentional, conscious and regenerative ways.

###### technology-enabled communities

every technology has values embedded in it.

[[sari azout\|sari]] captures my feelings well when she says:

and for deeper perspectives and practical examples of highly intentional and transformative technologies, check out [this podcast episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcbkdO7mHdY) on building [[collective intelligence tools\|collective intelligence tools]] for [[human alignment\|human alignment]] with [[nicholas brigham\|nicholas brigham]] from [[goodly labs\|goodly labs]].

i will dive into the deep implications of this, but i'll start with the aspects of the creator/experience economy that most people are familiar with.


CEP+N

###### creator communities, online courses, institutional communities

mighty networks, discord, telegram/whatsapp

###### [lofi girl](https://www.youtube.com/@LofiGirl), [the jazz hop cafÃ©](https://www.youtube.com/@TheJazzHopCafe), - ambient content.
(they're in fact virtual spaces)

- lofi/coffee shops are by far the most popular.
- ASMR, soundscapes, cityscapes
- nature sounds...
- medieval aesthetic, taverns, celtic
- futurist and retro, game soundtracks
- anime aesthetic
- artist-driven like [blue turtle](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRSg-mANRvOGLkV30EyW4jw) or [cosmic resort](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXw4yHjKbl8i2fv6Qba60Kw/)

esports orgs, game guilds, real-life collectives

-> RPGs / MMOs / neopets / LoL...

###### [[m3 metaverse makers\|M3]] - virtual hackerspace & community
**the stoa** - community-driven spaces -> next instance:
**vibecafe.xyz** - leveraging tools like gather to enable communities to be synchronous yet flexible, whisper/chatGPT to generate transcripts/blog posts/mindmaps, capsule.video to do shorts + other tools to promote connection, add serendipity and augment conversations (infranodus, etc).
gaoa.network / intentional society / etc...

metaverse folks (VRchat)
-> bluesky example.

creator economy folks, [[metalabel\|metalabel]], DAOs as groups of friends with a treasury

RADAR - future in sync



shared brains (knowledge commons), nature of social media

ultimately, [[sari\|sari]] captures it well here:
