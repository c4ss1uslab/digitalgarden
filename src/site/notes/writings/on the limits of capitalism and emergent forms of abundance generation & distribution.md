we know it's possible to live a more magical, fulfilling, nourishing reality. yet many times what seems to be in the way is money.

"we don't need money, we need people interested in pursuing alternatives and resources to make it happen"

an even more challenging topic though is "funding the transition".

a subject for a lot of study.
