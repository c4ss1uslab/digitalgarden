for a breakdown of how capitalism is self-terminating, see: [[people/references/architect;design/daniel schmachtenberger\|daniel schmachtenberger]]'s - [New Economic Series: Part 3 - When the System Is the Source of the Problems ‚Äì Case Studies](https://civilizationemerging.com/new-economics-series-3/).

deep down, we know it's possible to live a more magical, fulfilling, nourishing reality. yet many times what seems to be in the way is money.

"we don't need money, we need people interested in pursuing alternatives and resources to make it happen".

here are a few approaches that aim to address that:

##### basic sensemaking & historical references:

#### funding the transition

perhaps an even more challenging topic though is "funding the transition" (h2), especially without pricing out [[externalities\|externalities]].

a subject for a lot of study.

see: [[people/references/architect;design/daniel schmachtenberger\|daniel schmachtenberger]] on [design constraints for a viable economic system (New Economics Series: Part 1)](https://civilizationemerging.com/new-economics-series-1/)  and [essential criteria for this economic system (New Economics Series: Part 2)](https://civilizationemerging.com/new-economics-series-2/).
