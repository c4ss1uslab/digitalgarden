my response (august 26th, 2024):

i'm part of a community in brazil called [[responses/art/música do círculo\|música do círculo]] (https://musicadocirculo.com), which btw i'm starting this week a 2-year-long training to learn how to conduct. it's a practice that creates - in my description - "magic circles", i.e. a 1h-1h30 practice proposing games that promote human connection/development through collaborative musical experimentation/improvisation, only using the body (no instruments) and several facilitation elements/artifacts. anyone, with any level of experience/musicality can participate, have fun, learn and create music together.

beyond the musical references, it has a sound methodology informed by folks like eisenstein, NVC, pedagogy of cooperation (a local approach for collaborative learning that's been developed over the past 20 years here). it's a very intimate form of relating/collaborative music-making from the heart. though i can't say it's based on a metamodern framework, i find the practice itself and the way they have been developing it over time (past 13 years), based on real-life connection and experience, very empowering, inclusive and post-tragic. so i see it as a metamodern practice.

there's a few people conducting it in europe/US too (and doing the leading training as well), or doing somewhat-similar things in adjacent groups like the body music/vocal improvisation communities (though with not as much inclusivity/decoloniality, i find).

a few refs:
vocal improvisation communities: bobby mcferrin (omega institute), rhiannon (mostly US), the well vocal (US/europe). i've heard there's an especially active community in france.
for body music, see: barbatuques and the international body music festival.
i also see some traces of it in the beatbox community. see MB14's showcase at la cup worldwide 2018, for example.

i find the whole world of "world music" very related as well, which often isn't on spotify. i'm looking for references on that myself. particularly, i love a ukrainian "ethno-chaos" band called dakhabrakha and a brazilian collective of women researching world/indigenous music and re-creating it as their own renditions called mawaca (these two specifically are on spotify/youtube). another ref i know being: https://ethno.world/

ah, last comment on why i consider MdC metamodern: i find this way of relating/doing music incredibly ancestral (in a circle, no instruments, mainly non-verbal) AND modern (including: beatbox, newly developed body music alphabets/styles such as proposed by barbatuques' founder fernando barba and keith terry, and sourcing from all imaginable styles/influences that we've internalized from a globalized world. as long as the participants want to create it - from rap to metal to classic to folk to sound healing/atmospheric to theatrical... - everything's possible)
