this note is a placeholder for both an essay and a compilation of research/resources on why "woo", or [[topics/alchemy/spirituality\|spirituality]] in general, even if not often times factually correct, can be powerful and transformative - and what it means for our [[topics/alchemy/metaphysics\|metaphysics]], [[concepts/alchemy/epistemology\|epistemology]], [[concepts/alchemy/axiology\|axiology]] and [[cosmology\|cosmology]].

at the same time, there are plenty of potential problems that come with it, such as [[cults\|cults]], abusive behaviors/relationships, ethnocentrism, etc.

[[people/references/alchemy/hanzi freinacht\|hanzi freinacht]] explores it well in his [[_009_notes & highlights from books, videos, articles/listening society\|listening society]] book - on the less-seen pervasive effects of "[[magic beliefs\|magic beliefs]]" and how the confusion bred by the mix of [[vulnerability\|vulnerability]] and [[concepts/alchemy/non-ordinary states of consciousness\|non-ordinary states of consciousness]] of spiritual communities can be a recipe for disaster.

[[people/references/architect;design/tom morgan\|tom morgan]] also introduces some good frames such as [[anne-laure le cunff\|anne-laure le cunff]]'s "[Where are you on the Woo Spectrum?](https://newsletter.nesslabs.com/posts/ness-labs-where-are-you-on-the-woo-spectrum)" and the evolution of his own beliefs alongside a confidence percentage in his [what woo works](https://newsletter.theleading-edge.org/p/what-woo-works) article.

so this exploration intends to address - what is the middle ground? to what degree does [[faith\|faith]], [[trust\|trust]], [[devotion\|devotion]], [[service\|service]] play a beneficial role in our development as individuals and societies?

how can it be applied consciously?
