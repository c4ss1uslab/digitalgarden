this note is a placeholder for both an essay and a compilation of research/resources on why "woo", or [[topics/alchemy/spirituality\|spirituality]] in general, even if not often times factually correct, can be powerful and transformative - and what it means for our [[topics/alchemy/metaphysics\|metaphysics]], [[epistemology\|epistemology]], [[axiology\|axiology]] and [[cosmology\|cosmology]].

at the same time, there are plenty of potential problems that come with it, such as [[cults\|cults]], abusive behaviors/relationships, ethnocentrism, etc.

[[people/references/alchemy/hanzi freinacht\|hanzi freinacht]] explores it well in his [[listening society\|listening society]] book - on the less-seen pervasive effects of "[[magic beliefs\|magic beliefs]]" and how the confusion bred by the mix of [[vulnerability\|vulnerability]] and [[concepts/non-ordinary states of consciousness\|non-ordinary states of consciousness]] of spiritual communities can be a recipe for disaster.

so this exploration intends to address - what is the middle ground? to what degree does [[faith\|faith]], [[trust\|trust]], [[devotion\|devotion]], [[service\|service]] play a beneficial role in our development as individuals and societies?

how can it be applied consciously?
