###### assumed audience
if you're new to this, keep reading for a list of introductory resources. i also strongly suggest you read: [[_002_book-zine - viable pathways/why knowledge management matters (and goes way beyond what most PKM is about today)\|why knowledge management matters (and goes way beyond what most PKM is about today)]].

if you're already familiar with the field, i recommend you check out my posts: [[core essays/💭 foundational concepts for developing regenerative information ecologies & empowering knowledge commons\|💭 foundational concepts for developing regenerative information ecologies & empowering knowledge commons]], [[_003_L1F3/l1f3 management methodology\|L1F3 management framework]] and [[knowledge management system\|knowledge management system]] to have a comprehensive view on my learnings and the approach/design/prototypes i've been developing.

##### about

the concept/field of knowledge management has been really important for me since i was 15 years old (2014). i've seen the field change and evolve a lot, and i developed a lot of my own [[views\|views]], [[_000_MOCs/060 🗡 projects MOC\|projects]], [[designs\|designs]] and [[_000_MOCs/070 🔩 prototypes MOC\|prototypes]] since then.

#### an introduction

a few good introductory videos:
[\[lab\] - knowledge management fundamentals](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj8H7uBaUwDsUhxfKqk8f68erP3Ivo6G6)

a good visual overview of the BASB methodology (one of the most famous ones):

a loose/biased yet informative meme on the subject (by me):

#### a brief history of my relationship with the subject

--> [rework the text below]

much like [[tbprocessed/base notes/people/alexander obenauer\|alexander obenauer]] with the [[_002_book-zine - viable pathways/personal OS design\|future of operating systems]], [[gordon brander\|gordon brander]] with [[protocols for thought\|protocols for thought]] or [[samuel timbó\|samuel timbó]] with [[the future of computing\|the future of computing]], i have a vision for the future of information and knowledge management.

i've been working for the past months on organizing/conveying it under the [[_003_L1F3/l1f3 management methodology\|L1F3 management framework]].

head over there to learn about the framework in its details. now, if you wanna know more about where it came from, keep reading.

its origins date back to my first experience of spiritual awakening, that happened when i was 15 years old. when trying to figure out what to do with my life, i had a few simple yet profound life-changing realizations about myself and life itself, such as - [[life is action\|life is action]], [[life as your most important project\|my life is my biggest project]], [[the best way to predict the future is to create it\|the future is unknowable, yet some of it can be designed]], i operate in reality through an [[OODA loop\|OODA loop]], [[i can design myself and my life\|i can design myself and my life]] and [[life is a metagame\|life is a metagame]].

these realizations led me to a few months obsessively researching "how to organize my life", "how to manage a project", "how to manage myself", "tools for playing life more effectively" and trying to stick some spreadsheets together to create a comprehensive "[[l1f3 management system\|life management system]]".

even with all this effort, this was 2015 and i lacked the historical background and network to help me navigate this inquiry, so even though i started using [[GTD\|GTD]], [[evernote\|evernote]] and lots of coaching tools, it took me 3 years to stumble upon the term "**knowledge management**", and go beyond mainstream ideas, understanding it as both a practice and an actual [academic field of study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_management).

i tried some obscure software such as [[emacs\|emacs]], [[thebrain\|thebrain]], [[bitrix24\|bitrix24]], and my own mix of macros/spreadsheets, zapier/IFTTT and tons of other apps, but none of it worked nearly as well as i'd hoped.

to this day, it's extremely dumbfounding to me how we live in an [[information age\|information age]], yet this subject is mostly unknown, relegated as something just for librarians, some IT professionals, a few managers/nerds at a large company, or a handful of questionable consultants and obscure academics.

that is, until ~2018, when tools such as [[tbprocessed/base notes/tools;products - general/notion\|notion]], [[tbprocessed/base notes/ventures - general/roam research\|roam research]] and [[tbprocessed/base notes/ventures - general/obsidian\|obsidian]] were launched, bringing a new surge of popularity to this idea of "[[no-code\|no-code]]", [[tools for thought\|tools for thought]] and "online productivity tools" in general - and now it also became a subject for internet nerds. yay! 🙃

seriously though, since that time i've been dedicating a large amount of my time and energy thinking about "personal systems design" in the form of this "building a second brain" / "digital systems/workflow design", i'd be lying if i said this is the essence of it.

the same feeling that has been with me since my first experience of [[awakening\|awakening]] has changed and evolved in many ways, but still underlies everything i do, learn, sense, share and build in this field. i trust my judgment and experience above all (which is often times challenging, as it proves itself to be "wrong" or simply - true, but partial), but that unique "taste", "design", "feel" still remains as the guiding force, and while i still don't always follow it blindly, there's a unique value to it and i intend to let it unfold.

now, as to what this means in practice:

i believe that by spending a lot of time immersed in this field, but also removing myself completely from it at times and experiencing other walks of life - made me not be pigeonholed and discover several other strongly synergistic fields that don't often dialogue with knowledge management as a discipline/practice.

in fact, these are other areas (mentioned [here]()) that most people on the field don't even know exist (the paradox of a field that's precisely about evidencing knowledge) - and this experience, while incredibly confusing at first, gave me a lot of clarity on how we can move beyond academic propositions and cozy software to agentic psychotechnological tools that can empower and transform the experience of being yourself, even for people that never heard of the term.

and this isn't trashing on the field, i love most of it. i believe most of us researchers/practicioners feel this potential, but i also sense a strong lack of integration of our efforts, a lack on the clarity on the purpose of all this, plus too much hype, speculation, ego and moving in all directions, like in pretty much all other areas of modern civilization.

in short, my understanding/approach today is that:

i don't propose a "definitive" or "best" way to handle information, but i do believe that having clean and relevant data, able to be used in multiple [[interoperable\|interoperable]], [[agent-centric\|agent-centric]] apps and shared in lots of different, flexible, contextual [[life management system views\|views]], taking into account the different needs and preferences of people/institutions, sure is one of the better ones.

and i've been researching/building several systems, tools and prototypes in this direction - you can see more of them at my [[_000_MOCs/060 🗡 projects MOC\|projects]] page, or start with the [[l1f3 management system\|l1f3 management system]].
