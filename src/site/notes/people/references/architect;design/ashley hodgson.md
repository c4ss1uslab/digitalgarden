##### highlights from her work

in her video "[What is the Metacrisis? Why is it Hopeful?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgCHqyq4LHA)" she frames the [[concepts/design/metacrisis\|metacrisis]] as:
(transcript of the first 1:30 of the video)

> basically the issue is: if you look at all of these societal issues, where each issue has a community of people that are looking at that issue, looking at the evidence and shouting from the rooftops about that issue, if you zoom back and look at the entire landscape of issues we're facing as a society right now, there are connections between all of them. and there are common patterns between all of them, even though these different communities looking at different issues are essentially at odds with each other, fighting with each other and dismissing each other's evidence.
> 
> and here when i'm talking about issues, i mean things like:
> [[military\|military]] & [[geopolitical risks\|geopolitical risks]], decline in [[mental health\|mental health]], decline in [[friendship\|friendship]] and [[terms/community\|community]], breakdown in [[family structure\|family structure]], [[social media\|social media]] manipulation, [[corruption\|corruption]] of various sorts, [[environmental degradation\|environmental degradation]], [[surveillance\|surveillance]] risk, fragilities in the global [[financial system\|financial system]], escalating [[inequality\|inequality]], issues with the [[education system\|education system]] and the [[justice system\|justice system]], [[oil depletion\|oil depletion]].
> 
> and all of these issues have sub-categories, for example, under [[environmental degradation\|environmental degradation]] we have:
> - [[pesticides\|pesticides]]
> - [[microplastics\|microplastics]]
> - [[insect population collapse\|insect population collapse]]
> - etc, etc
> 
> so, the questions that she further explores in the video are:
> 1. why is this hopeful?
> 2. how exactly are these things connected?
> 3. is there a zero-sum battle between these? or should there be a zero-sum battle?
> (perhaps it's not as zero-sum as it seems)

i find this an amazing introduction to the subject. if we want to further dive into the landscape of issues/challenges we have, [[joshua williams\|joshua williams]]' [an introduction to the metacrisis](https://sites.google.com/view/intro-to-the-metacrisis) also provides a great overview of global [[concepts/design/existential risk\|existential]] and [[terms/catastrophic risk\|catastrophic risks]].


she advocates for a major shift in: [[diagnosis/self-terminating economic system\|economic systems]], [[governance systems\|governance systems]] and [[knowledge systems\|knowledge systems]] (akin to the enlightenment).
