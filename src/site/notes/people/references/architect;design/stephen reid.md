maintainer of [metacrisis.xyz](https://metacrisis.xyz). i align with much of his work/philosophy/research on [[topics/lab/artificial intelligence\|AI]], the [[concepts/design/metacrisis\|metacrisis]] and [[topics/regen/earth regeneration\|regeneration]], though i don't particularly resonate with him as a coach/educator. i really like some of his experiments such as the [knowledgegraphs](https://stephenreid.net/k) on his website, his own open-source [knowledgegraph](https://stephenreid.net/knowledgegraph) and fine-tuned [GPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-MIY7jLMJ4-stephen-reid). i strongly recommend people to check out the copyleft syllabus of his courses, as a curation of the complex, emerging fields of [[topics/design/technology\|technology]] <> [[topics/regen/earth regeneration\|regeneration]].

#### syllabus from his courses:
