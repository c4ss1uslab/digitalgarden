an interesting guy coming from the [[wall street\|wall street]] bubble into the [[concepts/design/metacrisis\|metacrisis]] space. he stewards a [[community of practice\|community of practice]] ([[the leading edge\|the leading edge]]) and is a big proponent of [[people/references/alchemy/iain mcgilchrist\|iain mcgilchrist]]'s work, presenting it and the [[concepts/design/metacrisis\|metacrisis]] communication in a more accessible way - taking a more psychological approach and pointing to [[concepts/alchemy/wisdom\|wisdom]] development, the great [[mystery\|mystery]]/[[topics/alchemy/spirituality\|spirituality]] through [[curiosity\|curiosity]] as a rationality-friendly (non-[[concepts/alchemy/energy work\|woo]]) way.

he gives me [[people/references/alchemy/aubrey marcus\|aubrey marcus]] vibes, aiming to build community/be a bridge-builder. but instead of speaking to a more [[topics/alchemy/spirituality\|spiritually]]-oriented audience, speaking to a [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1usâ€™ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/archive/databases/industry categories master list/business\|business]]-oriented one.
