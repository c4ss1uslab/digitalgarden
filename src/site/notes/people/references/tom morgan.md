an interesting guy in the [[tech entrepreneur\|tech entrepreneur]]/[[VC\|VC]] investment bubble, presenting [[iain mcgilchrist\|iain mcgilchrist]]'s work and the [[concepts/metacrisis\|metacrisis]] communication in a more mainstream fashion - framing it in more psychological terms and pointing to the great [[mystery\|mystery]] with/as [[curiosity\|curiosity]] as a focus/lens.

he gives me [[people/references/aubrey marcus\|aubrey marcus]] vibes, aiming to build community/be a bridge-builder. but instead of speaking to a more [[topics/alchemy/spirituality\|spiritually]]-oriented audience, speaking to a [[business\|business]]-oriented one.
