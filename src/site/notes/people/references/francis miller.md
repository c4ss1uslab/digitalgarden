everything he's published on his website is amazing, very detailed. fantastic if you're thinking deeply abound information/knowledge design/presentation - https://www.francismiller.com/articles/

##### a few of my highlights:

an amazing (although long) paper on organizing knowledge hierarchically/visually (great summary right on the first page): https://www.francismiller.com/organising-knowledge/

an amazing exploration that conveys the usefulness/shortcomings of summaries, exploring the nuances and potentials of depth/breadth (what he calls summary/detail) as a spectrum and the "learner experience": https://www.francismiller.com/in-defence-of-summaries/

great classification of knowledge structures + fantastic graphics: https://www.francismiller.com/knowledge-structures-an-introduction-to-the-concept/
