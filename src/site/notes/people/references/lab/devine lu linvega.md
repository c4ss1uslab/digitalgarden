##### a few favorite excerpts:

> In Antoine de Saint-ExupÃ©ry's book Wind, Sand and Stars, during a mail delivery, his plane crashes in the Sahara desert. There, he encounters a fox and notices that it only eats one berry in each bush. As he was starved, and that the bush was full of fruit, he couldn't understand why the fox would only take one. *This talk is about that fox, who knows better than to eat every berry which could harm both the bush and other desert dwellers.*

> I'm going to present technologies, but I won't give you their names, because my goal is that you will develop your own systems. I'm not selling you on any one technology.
> 
> Nowadays, people shop for solutions, and given enough time, it creates a vacuum of knowledge. Solutions are a way of obfuscating knowledge. Knowledge disappears when you go from one solution to the next without taking the time to understand the whole arc of the story. If you go on StackOverflow, solutions are offered in a way that you don't have to think about the problem. "Just use library function X" is not portable, it doesn't equate knowledge.
> 
> There is this myth that we're building on the shoulders of giants, but *when you're all the way up there on the giant's shoulders, it is really hard to steer it.* We should be careful of those who make theseÂ _bicycles-for-the-mind_.
