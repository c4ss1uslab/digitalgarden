https://gordonbrander.com/, founder of [[projects & tools/projects/lab/subconscious (tool)\|subconscious (tool)]], publishing an amazing newsletter at: https://newsletter.squishy.computer/

an incredibly deep thinker, researcher, writer and builder - one of my favorite human beings working in [[topics/architect;design/technology\|tech]], designing [[responses/design/protocols for thought\|protocols for thought]], i.e. open-source tools for [thinking together](https://subconscious.substack.com/p/thinking-together), [[topics/architect;design/coordination systems\|coordination systems]]/[[terms/collaboration\|collaboration]], at the intersection of [[topics/architect;design/tools for thought\|tools for thought]], [[topics/lab/artificial intelligence\|AI]], [[concepts/design/extended cognition\|extended cognition]], [[topics/lab/cybernetics\|cybernetics]] and more.

you'll definitely see me refer to a lot to him if you're exploring any of my [[_001_MOCs/050 🟩 mid game/070 🔩 prototypes MOC\|prototypes]] and [[designs\|designs]] of the [[_004_L1F3/L1F3 support systems\|L1F3 support systems]] and intentional [[_006_core notes/personal OS design\|personal OS]].

i'm working on compiling my highlights/notes from all of his articles. it'll be up on this page sometime soon.

#### key ideas

[[responses/design/protocols for thought\|protocols for thought]]

#### must-reads:

1) [Thinking Together - steps to an ecology of mind](https://subconscious.substack.com/p/thinking-together)

introduces brilliantly the need for and reasoning behind [[responses/design/protocols for thought\|protocols for thought]]. a key element for large-scale [[topics/architect;design/coordination systems\|coordination systems]], [[concepts/alchemy/sensemaking\|sensemaking]] and [[terms/collaboration\|collaboration]].


###### other important elements he brings:

simplifying/exploring foundational [[topics/lab/cybernetics\|cybernetics]]/[[topics/architect;design/systems design\|systems design]] concepts such as in [Unconcious R&D](https://newsletter.squishy.computer/p/unconscious-r-and-d), and the field's ideas, history and experiments synthesized into currently relevant explorations, such as in [Pond brains and GPT-4](https://newsletter.squishy.computer/p/pond-brains-and-gpt-4).
