one of my absolute favorite human beings working in [[_004_c4ss1us/c4ss.art\|art]]/[[topics/design/technology\|tech]] as a kind of "[[design engineer\|design engineer]]", mixing [[topics/design/anthropology\|anthropology]], [[topics/lab/interfaces MOC\|UI]]/[[topics/lab/UX design\|UX design]] and [[illustrations\|illustrations]] into her work/[[_001_research/research\|research]] on [[responses/lab/tools for thought\|tools for thought]], [[topics/lab/artificial intelligence\|AI]], [[concepts/design/extended cognition\|extended]]/[[concepts/alchemy/embodied cognition\|embodied cognition]] and more.

she has one of the best [[patterns/active patterns/knowledge design/digital gardening\|digital gardens]] out there, which you'll see me refer to a lot if you're exploring any of my [[_005_MOCs/050 ðŸŸ© mid game/070 ðŸ”© prototypes MOC\|prototypes]] and [[tbprocessed/AI-generated/designs\|designs]] of the [[life support systems\|life support systems]] and intentional [[responses/lab/personal OS design\|personal OS]].

i'm working on compiling my highlights/notes from all of her articles. it'll be up on this page sometime soon.
