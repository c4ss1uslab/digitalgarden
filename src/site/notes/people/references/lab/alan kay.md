one of the very influential early innovators in personal computing.

from wikipedia:
> [**Alan Curtis Kay**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay)Â (born May 17, 1940)Â is an AmericanÂ [computer scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_scientist "Computer scientist")Â best known for his pioneering work onÂ [object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming "Object-oriented programming")Â andÂ [windowing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_(computing) "Window (computing)")Â [graphical user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface "Graphical user interface")Â (GUI) design. AtÂ [Xerox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox "Xerox")Â [PARC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_(company) "PARC (company)")Â he led the design and development of the first modern windowedÂ [computer desktop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_metaphor "Desktop metaphor")Â interface. There he also led the development of the influentialÂ [object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming "Object-oriented programming")Â [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language "Programming language")Â [Smalltalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk "Smalltalk"), both personally designing most of the early versions of the language and coining the term "object-oriented."

his thoughts on [[education\|education]] involving [[topics/design/technology\|technology]], [[topics/lab/interfaces MOC\|user interfaces]], [[visuals\|visuals]] and [[world models\|world models]] are still very relevant today and have influenced people like [[people/references/lab/bret victor\|bret victor]], [[people/references/lab/maggie appleton\|maggie appleton]] and many other contemporary computer researchers/developers.
