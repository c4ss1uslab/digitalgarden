researcher on the [[topics/lab/the future of computing\|the future of computing]], [[topics/lab/spatial computing\|spatial computing]], [[concepts/design/extended cognition\|extended cognition]] and more. founder of [[projects & tools/tools/lab/dynamicland\|dynamicland]].

his main thesis reflects a frustration i held for a long time, but wasn't able to articulate: we invented the [[dynamic medium\|dynamic medium]] (you could interpret it as "[[topics/lab/computing\|computing]]", but see the references below for way more detail) and we still don't use it to 10% of its potential.

##### core videos:

1) [the humane representation of thought](https://vimeo.com/115154289) + [notes (very good diagram)](https://worrydream.com/TheHumaneRepresentationOfThought/note.html)

in it, he presents very simply and clearly his [[theory of change\|theory of change]]:

> Premise:
> New representations of thought — written language, numerals, mathematical notation, data graphics — have been responsible for some of the most significant leaps in the progress of civilization, by expanding humanity’s collectively-thinkable territory.
>
> Opportunity:
> The dynamic medium now exists. But dynamic representations of thought do not. Humanity is using the dynamic medium merely to emulate and extend static representations from the era of paper.
> 
> Intention:
> Use the dynamic medium to reinvent the representations of thought. Invent a way of thinking — imagining, understanding, creating, explaining — via dynamic representations that engage all modes of thought and respect the whole human being.

\+ more details, illustrations and his plan for application on [[projects & tools/tools/lab/dynamicland\|dynamicland]]. it's very similar to the vision i was prototyping with the [[projects & tools/projects/design/24h system\|24h system]] at [[high stakes academy\|high stakes academy]] back in 2019, minus the [[_004_L1F3/core concepts/life management\|life management]] aspect of it.

##### must-reads:

###### 1) [[references/player/learning/explorable explanations\|explorable explanations]]

introduces: [[reactive documents\|reactive documents]] (as seen in [[references/lab/ten brighter ideas\|ten brighter ideas]]), [[explorable examples\|explorable examples]], [[contextual information\|contextual information]].

###### 2) [what can a technologist do about climate change?](https://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/)

\*its application goes way beyond the topic of [[climate change\|climate change]]. i recommend reading it not only considering it, but the complex, entangled situation of our [[civilizational systems\|civilizational systems]] as whole - challenges, risks, shortcomings, biases, etc... it's a great starting point for exploring different large-scale action pathways.

it presents a few of the kinds of technical transformations/innovations/initiatives that are deeply needed and are not being talked about enough.

> they're both short, i recommend you read the full article, but you can skip to these to get why they're so important.

> on 1:
> he introduces important concepts i'll return to often when discussing [[topics/architect;design/coordination systems\|coordination systems]], [[terms/collaboration\|collaboration]], [[topics/alchemy/sensemaking\|sensemaking]]: [[model-driven debate\|model-driven debate]], [[model-driven reading\|model-driven reading]], [[model-driven authoring\|model-driven authoring]].

> these can be seen/experienced in his own [[references/lab/ten brighter ideas\|ten brighter ideas]], [[initiatives, orgs & communities/architect;design/the society library\|the society library]]'s debate maps, and more.
> 
> on 2:
> he shares a simple yet powerful framing of how we cannot afford as a society to continue with our businesses/governments/economies "as usual". there is and there can be no such thing as not being "mission-driven" (despite how coachy or wishy-washy that might sound). we're always optimizing for some things at the expanse of others, often unconsciously. we need to take this seriously and [end the reign of nihilistic design](https://consilienceproject.org/technology-is-not-values-neutral-ending-the-reign-of-nihilistic-design-2/). i urge you to read this and the article i just linked, deepening the analysis.

###### 3) [[seeing spaces\|seeing spaces]]

especially important considering his shift from focusing on our standard [[2d interfaces\|2d interfaces]] of modern computing to other forms of [[topics/player/spatial intelligence\|spatial intelligence]] and [[topics/lab/spatial computing\|spatial computing]].

###### 4) [[concepts/lab/learnable programming\|learnable programming]]

a new perspective on what programming should actually be/feel/look like. simply stated - humane, interpretable, intuitive. a practical vision (with examples/prototypes) that deeply resonates.
