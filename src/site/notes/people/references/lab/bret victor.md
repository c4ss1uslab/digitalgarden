bret is a visionary and researcher on the [[topics/lab/the future of computing\|the future of computing]], [[topics/lab/spatial computing\|spatial computing]], [[concepts/design/extended cognition\|extended cognition]] and more. he's the founder of [[initiatives, orgs & communities/lab/dynamicland\|dynamicland]].

his main thesis reflects a frustration i held for a long time, but wasn't able to articulate well: we invented the [[concepts/lab/dynamic medium\|dynamic medium]] (you could interpret it as "[[computers\|computers]]" or "[[topics/lab/computing\|computing]]" as a whole, but see the references below for way more detail) and we still don't use it to 10% of its potential. we don't explore the dimensions of dynamic [[responses/lab/systems modeling\|systems modeling]] it opens up. we use it ever so often to keep going with "business as usual", but more "productive". or put another way, we're often translating busywork from previously a desk into a "desktop".

a major part of the early vision of computer innovators, or more broadly - of [[responses/lab/tools for thought\|tools for thought]] researchers - was to [[people/references/lab/douglas engelbart\|augment human intellect]]. yet today, our relationship with this kind of technology has become often adversarial and exploitative. this has led bret to question and lead very interesting research on: *what is a "humane" dynamic medium? how might we build that?*

1) [the humane representation of thought](https://dynamicland.org/2014/The_Humane_Representation_of_Thought/) + [notes (very good diagram)](https://worrydream.com/TheHumaneRepresentationOfThought/note.html)

in it, he presents very simply and clearly his [[theory of change\|theory of change]]:

> Premise:
> New representations of thought â€” written language, numerals, mathematical notation, data graphics â€” have been responsible for some of the most significant leaps in the progress of civilization, by expanding humanityâ€™s collectively-thinkable territory.
>
> Opportunity:
> The dynamic medium now exists. But dynamic representations of thought do not. Humanity is using the dynamic medium merely to emulate and extend static representations from the era of paper.
> 
> Intention:
> Use the dynamic medium to reinvent the representations of thought. Invent a way of thinking â€” imagining, understanding, creating, explaining â€” via dynamic representations that engage all modes of thought and respect the whole human being.

\+ more details, illustrations and his plan for application on [[initiatives, orgs & communities/lab/dynamicland\|dynamicland]]. it's very similar to the vision i was prototyping with the [[projects & tools/projects/design/24h system\|24h system]] at [[high stakes academy\|high stakes academy]] back in 2019, minus my utter lack of technical skills and my bigger focus on the [[_004_L1F3/core concepts/life management\|life management]] aspect of it.

\*the application of this article goes way beyond the topic of [[climate change\|climate change]]. i recommend reading it not only considering our climate predicament, but the complex, entangled situation of our [[civilizational systems\|civilizational systems]] as whole - [[challenges\|challenges]], [[risks\|risks]], [[shortcomings\|shortcomings]], [[biases\|biases]], etc... it's a great starting point for exploring different large-scale action pathways. 
the article presents a few of the kinds of technological transformations/innovations/initiatives that are deeply needed and are not being talked about enough.

> he shares a simple yet powerful framing of how we cannot afford as a society to continue with our businesses/governments/economies "as usual". there is and there can be no such thing as not being "mission-driven" (& i'd add: [[concepts/design/impact metrics\|wide-boundary]] oriented). we're always optimizing for some things at the expense of others, often unconsciously. we need to take this seriously and [end the reign of nihilistic design](https://consilienceproject.org/technology-is-not-values-neutral-ending-the-reign-of-nihilistic-design-2/). i urge you to read this and the article i just linked, deepening the analysis.

###### 3) [[seeing spaces\|seeing spaces]]

especially important considering his shift from focusing on our standard [[2d interfaces\|2d interfaces]] of modern computing to other forms of [[topics/player/spatial intelligence\|spatial intelligence]] and [[topics/lab/spatial computing\|spatial computing]].

###### 4) [[concepts/lab/learnable programming\|learnable programming]]

a new perspective on what programming should actually be/feel/look like. simply stated - humane, interpretable, intuitive. a practical vision (with examples/prototypes) that deeply resonates.


and lots more...
