> Great conversation. Vanessa is so human, relatable, friendly, accessible, not what you generally a faculty dean associate with. I found her scepticism towards oxytocin effects a bit over the top. OXT is not primarily a hormone of „infantilization“, of „wishing oneself back to the womb“. The lack of OXT through civilisational stress, early parental separation, lack of breastfeeding, interrupted attachment bonds is supposedly at the root of many civilisation disorders like impaired attention span, emotional dysregulation, empathy deficits, narcissistic tendencies and others. Genetics, epigenetics and the concert of other neurotransmitters play their part but OXT certainly lays the foundation for a functional LHPA axis that we require for everything Vanessa is aspiring to.

> I can't help thinking of the resources and thousands of dollars that were spent to sent Andreotti and her team to work with indigenous people in a remote area, only to hear them say the total obvious - that which all spiritual traditions have been saying for millennia: "we need to trust the Invisible to make the impossible possible." And in typical academic arrogance, she and her team term this concept "spiritual bypassing." The best interview on this channel has been with Iain McGilchrist. If we take his insights seriously, we will know what needs to be done.

> I knew this would be awful when she gave a land acknowledgement at the beginning and it only went downhill from there. This is why I hate academics.

> **my comments:** who are these people (2nd and 3rd comments)??? they're selective enough to be on [[concepts/design/the great simplification\|the great simplification]] podcast, but not resonating with vanessa. how are they interpreting this? do they lump this in with other postmodern, wishy-washy, relativistic stuff?
