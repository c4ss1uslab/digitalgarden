one of my absolute favorite human beings working in [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss.art\|art]]/[[topics/architect;design/technology\|tech]] as a kind of "[[design engineer\|design engineer]]", mixing [[topics/architect;design/anthropology\|anthropology]], [[topics/lab/interfaces MOC\|UI]]/[[topics/lab/UX design\|UX design]] and [[illustrations\|illustrations]] into her work/[[topics/architect;design/research\|research]] on [[topics/architect;design/tools for thought\|tools for thought]], [[topics/lab/artificial intelligence\|AI]], [[concepts/extended cognition\|extended]]/[[concepts/embodied cognition\|embodied cognition]] and more.

she has one of the best [[topics/lab/digital gardening\|digital gardens]] out there, which you'll see me refer to a lot if you're exploring any of my [[_001_MOCs/050 ðŸŸ© mid game/070 ðŸ”© prototypes MOC\|prototypes]] and [[designs\|designs]] of the [[life support systems\|life support systems]] and intentional [[_006_core notes/personal OS design\|personal OS]].

i'm working on compiling my highlights/notes from all of her articles. it'll be up on this page sometime soon.
