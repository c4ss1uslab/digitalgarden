##### about

in this essay i argue that the next stage for intentional collectives is to consciously integrate the concept of [[networked living\|networked living]].

we'll talk about: [[concepts/design/third spaces\|third spaces]], [[energy management\|energy management]], [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss.host\|facilitation]]/[[community organizing tools\|community organizing tools]], [[topics/design/curation\|curation]]/[[shared brains\|shared brains]], [[communal infrastructure\|communal]]/[[digital infrastructure\|digital infrastructure]] and [[_004_L1F3/core concepts/life design\|life design]] as ways to move beyond divise patterns of interaction, towards integrating [[interdependence\|interdependence]] into people's actual [[_004_L1F3/core concepts/lifestyles\|ways of living]].

perspectives on this page come mostly from a few different places - folks in the [[cozy web\|cozy web]]/[[indie web\|indie web]]/[[slow web\|slow web]] communities, my experience with several [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss.host\|facilitation]] tools and practices, and in [[topics/alchemy/spirituality\|spiritual]]/[[philosophy\|philosophical]]/[[topics/design/regeneration\|regenerative]] circles...

##### context

my experience of the COVID-19 pandemics was 1 year longer than everyone else. when it struck, i was already on my 11th month isolated from the world.

i was going through some intense emotional healing processes, and found that my only way to cope was to read, meditate, research and ritualize. so during that time i had the privilege - and challenge - of spending 95% of 3 years alone, in my room, introspecting, learning about myself and the world (via books and the internet), while rediscovering what moved me.

during that time, i couldn't find many online communities that resonated with what i was experiencing and the themes that were alive to me. so this time in isolation made reflect and research a lot on the themes of [[belonging\|belonging]], the [[internet\|internet]], [[topics/host/community building\|community building]] and [[memetic tribes\|memetic tribes]], especially related to the state and the potential of our [[information ecology\|information ecology]] and [[online communities\|online communities]].

in 2023, my life has been pretty much the opposite. going to ecovillages, farms, marginalized communities, courses, retreats and all sorts of cultural, local community events in são paulo, brazil.

in this article, i aim to gather my findings, curation and perspectives on the [[future of communities\|future of communities]] and the [[internet\|internet]] - and subjacent themes, such as the [[terms/metaverse\|metaverse]], [[responses/design/trust networks\|trust networks]] and a lot more. i bring special attention to **[[intentional online communities\|intentional online communities]]** and **[[concepts/design/third spaces\|third spaces]]** as cultural [[attractors\|attractors]]. they're places that can feel more like home than at home or at work.

##### definitions

so, what's the role of [[initiatives, orgs & communities/communities MOC\|communities]]? how about [[intentional communities\|intentional ones]]?

how about [[community organizers\|community organizers]] - or [[community organizing\|community organizing]] as a whole?

as a crude but interesting starting point, one could say, answering all of the above: to meet collective [[concepts/alchemy/needs\|needs]] and coordinate the use of [[concepts/design/resources\|resources]].

beyond formal [[institutions\|institutions]], communities have long organized as [[terms/spiritual communities\|sanghas]], [[collectives\|collectives]], [[concepts/design/communities of practice\|communities of practice]], [[topics/design/local communities\|local]]/[[bioregion\|bioregional representations]] and more.



a deeper inquiry we'll dive into: what's the role of [[topics/design/curation\|curation]], [[communities\|communities]] & [[distributed sensemaking\|distributed sensemaking]] amidst accelerating [[attention economy\|attention]] & [[experience economy\|experience economies]]? and what tools are available/necessary for them?


##### x) [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss.host\|facilitation]] - the limitations of the current paradigm

we've seen a rise in "community managers" - whether in corporate contexts or in social organizing, and a wider recognition of several facilitation tools and methods.

despite my appreciation for many of them, for the longest time, i've been carrying a frustration regarding many approaches, and - sorry friends (it's not about you!) - with many facilitators too.

i feel that most of these approaches have a lack of **[[depth\|depth]]** and **[[_006_core notes/design principles\|continuity]]**, which is directly tied to a non-recognition of [[_009_notes & highlights from books, videos, articles/listening society\|hierarchies]] and [[models & frameworks/player/fourgames\|systemic influences]] on people's lives.

while potentially powerful on their impact on transforming [[concepts/alchemy/consciousness development\|individual consciousness]], their effectiveness on any form of societal transformation seems - in my analysis - thwarted by this.

many of these approaches have good intentions of being holistic, integrating lots of people and perspectives, but while embedded in a widespread reality of [[time scarcity\|time scarcity]], in an [[diagnosis/self-terminating economic system\|economic system]] designed towards [[models & frameworks/design/8 forms of capital\|unidimensional (monetary) optimization]], they can often be disregarded as "cool", "cute" or "aspirational" approaches, with low or no practical outcomes.

in trying to integrate multiple perspectives as equally valid, this posture gets in the way of precisely recognizing the **unique power and wisdom that each different perspective holds**. their **unique place in the whole**. some perspectives are more important, impactful, holistic than others - depending on the context. and they need to be recognized for it!

just like people's contributions, availability, responsibilities in a certain project are different - they often aren't equally important for it - and therefore, should not be equally compensated (financially or otherwise). a dynamic process of [[sensing\|sensing]] and [[engaging\|engaging]], that honors people's [[concepts/alchemy/human development\|stage of development]] across different lines, create the possibility to actually create.

i'm not the first to point this out, but i'm verbalizing it here since there are many emergent approaches trying to address this, but i'm yet to find a single one that goes broad and deep enough. to me, this points to this circumstance as an open field of investigation and development for many years to come.

it's no surprise then that the [[_004_L1F3/L1F3 support systems\|L1F3 support systems]] i've been envisioning aim to integrate these tools/perspectives into people's daily lives and activities. and sustain them as part of a wider context - anchored on a more wholistic approach to [[concepts/design/value\|value]] and [[concepts/design/resources\|resources]] allocation (i.e. [[_004_L1F3/core concepts/life streaming\|life streaming]]). so these tools stop being siloed, cool things that you apply once at an immersion and then forget about it.

##### x) emergent responses


- [[topics/design/coordination systems\|coordination systems]] -> [[diagnosis/self-terminating economic system\|economic systems]], [[models & frameworks/design/8 forms of capital\|8 forms of capital]], [[social activism\|social activism]]


	- [[patterns/active patterns/ambient co-presence\|ambient co-presence]] (discord, [[projects & tools/projects/lab/subconscious (tool)\|subconscious (tool)]]'s [[concepts/lab/geists\|geists]], [[projects & tools/projects/lab/commonplace (app)\|commonplace (app)]]'s fish)

[[responses/alchemy/integral theory\|integral theory]] & [[responses/alchemy/metamodernism\|metamodernism]] provide philosophical, scientific and [sociological?] grounding for it.

[[responses/art/música do círculo\|música do círculo]] and some [[models & frameworks/host/cooperation pedagogy\|cooperation pedagogy]] activities are beautiful examples of how to meaningfully integrate different levels of development in ways that are synergistic for the whole.

[[models & frameworks/design/metadesign\|metadesign]]: designing the context in which designing/co-creation happens.

fundamental patterns.

before exploring comprehensive approaches, let's dive into topics:

formats such as [[world café\|world café]], [[unconference\|unconference]], [[liberating structures\|liberating structures]] or [[_010_notes from courses, events & chats/2023-10 - microsolidarity practice program notes\|microsolidarity]]

create open space for [[emergence\|emergence]] and attempt to tap into [[concepts/design/collective intelligence\|collective intelligence]].

however, like i mentioned in [[continuity\|continuity]], these ways of relating require ongoing practice to be cultivate such intelligence.

but not only practice. these practices don't happen in a vacuum - what substrate are they happening on top of?

[[topics/design/curation\|curation]], etc comes in.

🌀 [[concepts/design/third spaces\|third spaces]] / [[energy management\|energy management]] & [[concepts/design/resources\|resources management]] article:

early expressions of "[[responses/design/metamodern guilds\|metamodern guilds]]", in the direction of "[[initiatives, orgs & communities/design/nooNAO\|NAOs]]":
- [[terms/DAOs\|DAOs]]
- [[digital communities\|digital communities]] ()
- [[digital environments\|digital environments]] ([[initiatives, orgs & communities/lab/m3 metaverse makers\|M3 metaverse makers]], [[vibecafe.xyz\|vibecafe.xyz]])


what it helps with the most:
don't start from scratch -> shared/pre-determined context: music, visuals, language, etc...

⭐️ make distinctions around collective intelligence [spaces / tools / systems] clear, visible, explicit - accessible & persistent.
- esp. for intentionally-designed collaborative spaces

-> shared values + visible resources + mapped ways to create value = enable collaboration

[high-value/high-return activities - trust networks (DAOs/coops) - circular economies]

🚨 issue/challenge: coordination.

enabling it:

💭 subconscious:
TfT / web3 / XR -> semantic, distributed, spatial web

trust/knowledge networks.

knowledge structures -> lists, trees, grids, networks (graphs)

—————-

my curation can be of the utmost value if:

in my writing, i can share/clearly state the insights/learnings i gathered by inhabiting these diverse archetypes/domains of knowledge.

e.g.: present my [[models & frameworks/host/CEP+N\|CEP+N]] at each article.
-> design nerds: daniel, rieki, vassão, etc
-> builder nerds: sephist, dgardens, etc
-> art: fablab, mdc, domestika, rap geek...

##### intro

the dilemma of every artist/creator - personal vs economic incentives

###### the magic that is unlocked in community

resonance, possibility.

cherished and encouraged to be your most unique self.

decentralization of resources -> 16x population, 100x resource consumption.

[[topics/design/market intelligence\|market intelligence]], [[trends\|trends]], [[foresight\|foresight]].

##### creator, curator & experience economies

###### unique potentials and challenges of in-person vs virtual communities

if there's something that persisted even after a lot of western influence and colonization (for its lights and shadows) in the global south culture is that we're a lot more communitarian. everyone is friends, everyone is family.

communities like [[initiatives, orgs & communities/player/MoL\|MoL]] and [[initiatives, orgs & communities/host/instituto amuta\|instituto amuta]] recognize this and are deliberately studying and practicing culture-building in more intentional, conscious and regenerative ways.

###### technology-enabled communities

every technology has values embedded in it.

[[people/references/architect;design/sari azout\|sari]] captures my feelings well when she says:

and for deeper perspectives and practical examples of highly intentional and transformative technologies, check out [this podcast episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcbkdO7mHdY) on building [[collective intelligence tools\|collective intelligence tools]] for [[human alignment\|human alignment]] with [[nicholas brigham\|nicholas brigham]] from [[initiatives, orgs & communities/design/goodly labs\|goodly labs]].

i will dive into the deep implications of this, but i'll start with the aspects of the creator/experience economy that most people are familiar with.


CEP+N

###### creator communities, online courses, institutional communities

mighty networks, discord, telegram/whatsapp

###### [lofi girl](https://www.youtube.com/@LofiGirl), [the jazz hop café](https://www.youtube.com/@TheJazzHopCafe), - ambient content.
(they're in fact virtual spaces)

- lofi/coffee shops are by far the most popular.
- ASMR, soundscapes, cityscapes
- nature sounds...
- medieval aesthetic, taverns, celtic
- futurist and retro, game soundtracks
- anime aesthetic
- artist-driven like [blue turtle](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRSg-mANRvOGLkV30EyW4jw) or [cosmic resort](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXw4yHjKbl8i2fv6Qba60Kw/)

esports orgs, game guilds, real-life collectives

-> RPGs / MMOs / neopets / LoL...

###### [[initiatives, orgs & communities/lab/m3 metaverse makers\|M3]] - virtual hackerspace & community

[hackerspace]

[XR book]

###### **the stoa** - community-driven spaces -> next instance:

###### **vibecafe.xyz**

leveraging tools like gather to enable communities to be synchronous yet flexible, whisper/chatGPT to generate transcripts/blog posts/mindmaps, capsule.video to do shorts + other tools to promote connection, add serendipity and augment conversations (infranodus, etc).

###### others:
gaoa.network / intentional society / etc...

metaverse folks (VRchat)
-> bluesky example.

creator economy folks, [[metalabel\|metalabel]], DAOs as groups of friends with a treasury

RADAR - future in sync



shared brains (knowledge commons), nature of social media
