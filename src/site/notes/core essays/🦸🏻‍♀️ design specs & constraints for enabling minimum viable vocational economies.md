for an 80-page-plus guidebook + 12-episode series breaking down how our economic system can be redesigned, see: [SEEDS guide].

3-horizon approach. we'll focus on 1st horizon on this. ("make minimal changes, understand impact on the whole" doesn't help if you're in deep suffering right now. change now, reflect later.)

more to add: measuring GDP.

how money can be beautiful: [[concepts/sacred economics\|sacred economics]].

our economic system has an extractive, scarce worldview. abundance isn't having "infinite", "more than you need".

-> how to enable that sacred economy? + how to economically viabilize working on your ikigai?

(minimum/gradual steps?)

this is a real challenge that i've struggled with a lot, not sure i found a comprehensive answer yet, but i did find a lot of possibilities/hints.
