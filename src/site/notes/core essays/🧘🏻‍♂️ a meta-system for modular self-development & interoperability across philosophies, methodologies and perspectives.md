sub-title: **approaches to self design, self as a system, encoded philosophy, integral spirituality and conscious life operating systems**.

##### 1) mapping approaches to self-transformation

integral theory already did that with [[religions\|religions]], [[spiritual lineages\|wisdom traditions]], [[scientific discoveries\|scientific discoveries]] and [[psychological studies\|psychological studies]].

i could quote the works of [[eric brown\|eric brown]] on [hedonic engineering: building a psycho-spiritual growth stack](https://seriousplay.substack.com/p/hedonic-engineering), [[euvie ivanova\|euvie ivanova]] on [psycho-technologies for the age of collapse](https://euvieivanova.substack.com/p/psycho-technologies-for-the-age-of), [[john vervaeke\|john vervaeke]] on [religion that is not a religion](https://www.youtube.com/@johnvervaeke), [psychotechnologies and distributed cognition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=237-jbJfleY) and the [[meaning crisis\|meaning crisis]] as a whole. (i love their works and recommend all of them)

my good friend [[marcelo peterlini\|marcelo peterlini]] also has been doing his own research and co-creation with [[daniel thorson\|daniel thorson]] on the [[church of the intimate web\|church of the intimate web]], which also features a synthetization of a lot of powerful perspectives.

plus some [[organizations & communities/possibility management\|possibility management]] on [[thoughtware upgrades\|thoughtware upgrades]]... and many others [to be explored]. sadhguru - self-engineering, [[spiritual lineages\|spiritual lineages]]...

most of these aim to be multiperspectival, open-ended, integrative approaches to self-development and spirituality, but that's still what makes the most sense and resonates for me.

##### is coordinating different perspectives even possible?

yes.

[[goodly labs\|goodly labs]] are doing a great job around coordinating perspectives. i'll dive into it more on my next article ([[core essays/💭 foundational concepts for developing regenerative information ecologies & empowering knowledge commons\|💭 foundational concepts for developing regenerative information ecologies & empowering knowledge commons]]), but [[the society library\|the society library]] also.

beyond [[concepts/integral theory\|integral]], there's a lot of work being done with [[teal organizations\|teal organizations]], (...)

[...]

we can be forever seeking "who has/what is the more comprehensive/coherent/whole approach". so i believe this is more of an individual unfoldment path.

we all came here with different missions, needs, backgrounds and challenges. "all paths lead to the tao, but not all are equally valuable".

the age-old challenge of [[self design\|self design]] is as much a work of [[designing\|design]] as of [[discovery\|discovery]] and [[deconstruction\|deconstruction]].

![integral dashboard.jpg](/img/user/integral%20dashboard.jpg)

any new discovery becomes just another "tab" or "widget" there, that opens up a whole rabbit hole of [[discovery\|discovery]] and [[investigation\|investigation]].

-> why integral is so powerful: it provides as close to an agnostic view as possible (or at least that i've seen). a way of indexing, interpreting and categorizing spiritual (and more) experiences.

if we break down processes, there are: [[consciousness development\|consciousness development]] itself ([[states\|states]] & [[stages\|stages]]), [[psychological development\|psychological development]], [[learning\|learning]], [[lines of intelligence\|lines of intelligence]], [[trauma\|trauma]], [[intimacy development\|intimacy development]], [[shadow work\|shadow work]], [[parts work\|parts work]], [[flow states\|flow states]], [[altered states\|altered states]], etc...

i favor a modular approach. you don't need to agree with the complete worldview of a certain approach, practice or tradition, but practice/experiment with it and develop more depth over time. the point is to gradually explore, learn and incorporate what makes sense for you into your personal systems.

gamers are usually familiar with this idea since they're often tweaking their games with [[DLCs\|DLCs]] or [[mods\|mods]].

##### a meta-systemic approach


##### your [[_003_L1F3/l1f3 operating system\|life operating system]]

in nerd terms: [[epistemology\|epistemology]], [[metaphysics\|metaphysics]], [[ontology\|ontology]].

the set of [[beliefs\|beliefs]], [[values\|values]], [[conditionings\|conditionings]] with which you operate in life.
