#### intro & context

learning is a huge topic, so i'll share a few of the perspectives and resources that have been the most alive for me over the past few years.

in this essay i'm going to focus more on the perspective of the individual [[learner\|learner]], as she navigates the increasing complexity of our world.

institutionalized [[education\|education]] is a very impactful area of our world today, and there are wonderful works of people like [[zak stein\|zak stein]] with [[education in a time between worlds\|education in a time between worlds]] and initiatives that support holistic learning in the form of [[self-development\|self-development]], [[topics/regen/earth regeneration\|regeneration]], [[decolonization\|decolonization]], [[social responsibility\|social responsibility]] and [[civic engagement\|civic engagement]] such as [[bildung\|bildung]], [[ecoversities\|ecoversities]], [[gaia education\|gaia education]], [[civic square\|civic square]] and many others. i have even curated an [[experiments/innovative education projects & organizations database\|innovative education projects & organizations database]].

but the discussion about systemic impacts of our existing educational design and emergent approaches will come later. after all, we create institutions, pedagogies, tools, resources and support networks, precisely to support individuals in their learning processes.

for now, there are many resources out there on [[unschooling\|unschooling]], [[homeschooling\|homeschooling]] and [[topics/player/self-directed learning\|self-directed learning]]. in brazil, there are many folks doing amazing work on this direction such as [[people/acquaintances/alex bretas\|alex bretas]] and [[people/acquaintances/luis s√©rgio ferreira\|luis s√©rgio ferreira]], as well as transformative [[topics/player/pedagogical approaches\|pedagogical approaches]] such as [[models & frameworks/pedagogia do oprimido\|pedagogy of the oppressed]] and [[models & frameworks/pedagogia da coopera√ß√£o\|cooperation pedagogy]] that add to the more disseminated [[montessori\|montessori]], [[models & frameworks/waldorf\|waldorf]], [[constructivism\|constructivist]] approaches. beyond their bright contributions to the field, from my own experience of growing up being obsessed with [[topics/player/gaming\|gaming]] and seeing how much it both developed and hindered my [[cognitive processes\|cognitive processes]], i'm particularly interested in the role of [[concepts/game\|games]] and [[topics/architect;design/technology\|technology]] in learning.

there are many fields that deepen this understanding, such as [[topics/architect;design/serious games\|serious games]], (...), [[topics/player/computer supported collaborative learning\|computer supported collaborative learning]], but where i found the most enlightening perspectives/literature was in the studies of [[cognitive science\|cognitive science]], [[concepts/extended cognition\|extended cognition]], [[topics/lab/knowledge management\|knowledge management]] and [[topics/architect;design/tools for thought\|tools for thought]].

this, plus the tons of value i found in my own [[topics/architect;design/anthropology\|anthropological]] explorations/research on [[topics/alchemy/spiritual lineages\|wisdom traditions]] such as [[terms/buddhism\|buddhism]], [[taoism\|taoism]] and [[shamanism\|shamanism]], as well as emergent fields such as [[adult development theory\|adult development theory]], [[models & frameworks/integral theory\|integral theory]] and [[responses/alchemy/metamodernism\|metamodernism]] will compose the majority of this article.

granted, i still haven't delved as deep into early [[topics/lab/cybernetics\|cybernetics]], [[information theory\|information theory]] and a few other [[topics/lab/computer science\|computer scienc-y]] topics, which hold [[topics/architect;design/personal algorithms design\|very interesting insights too]].

#### a few important distinctions

##### 1) active vs passive learning

the first simple, yet major distinction that helps me make sense of everything else to come is that there are 2 "paths", "modes" or "approaches" of learning/growth/transformation:

[[active\|active]] & [[passive\|passive]]. they're always on and you're always flickering through them. they kind of map into [[iain mcgilchrist\|iain mcgilchrist]]'s research on [[brain hemispheres\|brain hemispheres]] (right and left).

active: intentional focus, objective-oriented approach. maximize your active time (biohacking, support systems, etc), design your lifestyle. (RH).

you experience this type of flow by intensely focusing/directing your attention into something.

passive: optimize your systems/environments so you're learning even during downtime/low-energy moments. "learning through osmosis". "you are the result of the 5 people you live with the most". [[models & frameworks/CEP+N\|CEP+N]]. (LH)

you experience this type of flow by intensely letting go into the experience, into what's emerging NOW.

modern western culture is much more used to the right hemisphere route - define priorities, goals, plan, act on it.

but the feeling of [[interconnectedness\|interconnectedness]], [[concepts/flow\|flow]], [[magic\|magic]], only really happens when we're able to tap into this other hemisphere.

##### 2) expanding our understanding of knowledge & cognition

cognitive scientist and buddhist scholar [[people/references/alchemy/john vervaeke\|john vervaeke]] proposes 4 [[concepts/ways of knowing\|ways of knowing]], being they: 1) participatory; 2) perspectival; 3) procedural; and 4) propositional knowing.

that's somewhat associated with the concept of [[cognition\|cognition]] as [[concepts/4e cognition\|4e cognition]]: 1) [[concepts/enacted cognition\|enacted]]; 2) [[concepts/embedded cognition\|embedded]]; 3) [[concepts/embodied cognition\|embodied]]; and 4) [[concepts/extended cognition\|extended]].

the role of [[topics/architect;design/ontological design\|ontological design]] in learning: how much context influences us and tapping into other forms of [[intelligence\|intelligence]].

researchers/practitioners such as [[people/references/lab/maggie appleton\|maggie appleton]] on [the primacy of metaphor in learning, visual communication](https://maggieappleton.com/programming-pictures) and [in the design of our whole web](https://maggieappleton.com/metaphors-web).

[[people/references/lab/gordon brander\|gordon brander]] on [[personal systems design\|personal systems design]].

[[people/references/lab/bret victor\|bret victor]] - on exploring the unique capabilities of the computational medium - to help us move [beyond interactivity](https://vimeo.com/64895205), into creating/representing [[world models\|world models]] and enabling new [[[modes of thinking\|[modes of thinking]]]. a few great examples: [a brief rant on the future of interaction design](https://worrydream.com/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign/), [explorable explanations](https://worrydream.com/ExplorableExplanations/). simple examples/low-hanging fruits: [scrollscape](https://joshuahhh.com/about-scrollscape/)...

[[andy matuschak\|andy matuschak]] & [[people/references/lab/michael nielsen\|michael nielsen]]'s cornerstone work on [developing transformative tools for thought]([How can we develop transformative tools for thought?](https://numinous.productions/ttft/)), [augmenting long-term memory](https://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html) and [intelligence as a whole](https://distill.pub/2017/aia/).

[[people/references/lab/jacky zhao\|jacky zhao]]'s ideas and curation on [[research debt\|research debt]], [[knowledge distillation\|knowledge distillation]], [[interoperability\|interoperability]], [[composability\|composability]], [[topics/architect;design/distributed systems\|distributed systems]] and [[topics/lab/human-computer interaction\|human-computer interaction]].

\+ speculative designs/prototypes such as [[projects & tools/projects/design/xanadu\|project xanadu]], [[projects & tools/projects/design/wonderOS\|wonderOS]], [[projects & tools/projects/design/mercuryOS\|mercuryOS]], [[projects & tools/projects/lab/codexOS\|codexOS]], and my own [[_004_L1F3/l1f3 operating system\|l1f3 OS]].

\+ other researchers such as: [[people/references/architect;design/raghav agrawal\|raghav agrawal]], [[people/references/lab/omar rizwan\|omar rizwan]], [[serj hunt\|serj hunt]] and pretty much anyone associated with the [[initiatives, orgs & communities/lab/ink & switch\|ink & switch]] lab.

\++ communities that apply these principles in practice such as [[responses/art/m√∫sica do c√≠rculo\|m√∫sica do c√≠rculo]] - [[concepts/4e cognition\|4e cognition]], [[references/design/4e cognition and music - integrative literature review\|4e cognition and music - integrative literature review]].



they point at something that rings very true to my young, eager, child self: ‚¨á

[[visual\|visual]], [[topics/player/spatial intelligence\|spatial]], [[interactive\|interactive]] learning.

##### 3) discovery-based learning

learning is much more effective if we have [[immersion\|immersion]] and [[meaning\|meaning]] in a [[terms/persistence\|persistent]] context. -> curiosity-driven, agent-driven vs imposed.

they give the learner agency ([[interactivity\|interactivity]]) and meaning through [[worldbuilding\|worldbuilding]] - major aspects of gamified learning - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_uH-C5MZRA

it's easy to talk about

discovery-driven, insight-driven, learner-driven, proposition-driven, provocation-driven, curiosity-driven learning.

who is doing it, and how?

-> [[globe engineer\|globe engineer]]
-> [[initiatives, orgs & communities/architect;design/sublime (ex-startupy)\|sublime]]
-> [[projects & tools/tools/player/learn anything\|learn anything]]

can you have it really be divorced from disciplines? abordagens conteudistas (discipline-based). (e.g. TTfT on memorizing key elements of a field).

knowledge-based (insight-based) -> thing is: block-level. -> a book isn't an approachable level of abstraction. neither is a paper. an article is more like it. supporting, challenging and given context to a paragraph.



caution: "learning porn" (as in developing skills), not reflecting, applying, sharing with others -> 4-quadrant journeys, rest, other frames of relative importance.
