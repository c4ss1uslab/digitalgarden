##### 1) mapping approaches to [[topics/alchemy/spirituality\|spirituality]] and [[_003_L1F3/core concepts/self-transformation\|self-transformation]]

```ad-hint

these topics can be very emotionally challenging, so i'll do my best to tread them carefully. i ask you read it in good faith and to assume it on my part as well.
```

if we compare the propositions of different [[topics/alchemy/spiritual lineages\|wisdom traditions]], [[scientific discoveries\|scientific discoveries]] and [[psychological studies\|psychological studies]], we see that they're actually not thaaat different. there's a lot of agreement among them.

there are definitely irreconcilable differences that we can focus on, but we can find ways in which many of the differences can actually be complementary as well.

[[tbprocessed/evernote/0 - inbox/ken wilber\|tbprocessed/evernote/0 - inbox/ken wilber]] has done a lot of this comparative work across traditions and modern science/academia already. and many people have been building upon it:

[[jamie wheal\|jamie wheal]] on [[recapture the rapture\|recapture the rapture]], [[barbara marx hubbard\|barbara marx hubbard]] on [[tbprocessed/base notes/concepts - general/conscious evolution\|conscious evolution]], [[marc gafni\|marc gafni]] on [[unique self\|unique self]], [[people/references/alchemy/john vervaeke\|john vervaeke]] on [religion that is not a religion](https://www.youtube.com/@johnvervaeke), [psychotechnologies and distributed cognition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=237-jbJfleY), and the [[diagnosis/meaning crisis\|meaning crisis]] as a whole. (i love their works and recommend all of them)

i have been slowly joining forces with my good friend [[people/friends/marcelo peterlini\|marcelo peterlini]] as part of the [[mettatropical collective\|mettatropical collective]], who has also been doing his own research and perspectives on the [[mettacrisis\|mettacrisis]], as well as [[people/references/alchemy/daniel thorson\|daniel thorson]] with the [[initiatives, orgs & communities/alchemy/church of the intimate web\|church of the intimate web]], which also features a synthetization of a lot of powerful perspectives.

plus, there are a lot more curators/practitioners such as [[eric brown\|eric brown]] [hedonic engineering: building a psycho-spiritual growth stack](https://seriousplay.substack.com/p/hedonic-engineering), [[euvie ivanova\|euvie ivanova]] on [psycho-technologies for the age of collapse](https://euvieivanova.substack.com/p/psycho-technologies-for-the-age-of), [[layman pascal\|layman pascal]], (...), adding to it.

all of these share an aim to be multi-perspectival, integrative approaches to [[_003_L1F3/core concepts/self-transformation\|self-transformation]] and [[topics/alchemy/spirituality\|spirituality]], but i'm sure there are many more that hold valuable pieces of wisdom.

[[initiatives, orgs & communities/alchemy/possibility management\|possibility management]] with [[thoughtware upgrades\|thoughtware upgrades]], [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1us’ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/archive/databases/content creators master list/sadhguru\|sadhguru]] with [[self-engineering\|self-engineering]], and many others to be discovered...

> my proposal is: if we start with the intersection of "broadly acceptable" [[beliefs\|beliefs]]/[[practices\|practices]] across these different philosophies and traditions, we can work with what we have - cultivating [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1us’ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/bookmarks/Trust\|trust]], [[love\|love]], [[understanding\|understanding]] and [[diagnosis/intimacy crisis\|intimacy]] - and slowly expand into the more complex, nuanced, inflammable territories.

##### is coordinating different perspectives even possible?

depending on who you ask, the answer will vary greatly. some might say that politics, for example, shows that it's a resounding no. while others will say that politics, for example, shows that it's a resounding yes. ironic, huh?

the [[initiatives, orgs & communities/design/meaning alignment institute\|meaning alignment institute]] and [[initiatives, orgs & communities/design/goodly labs\|goodly labs]] are two examples of institutions doing a great job using [[topics/design/technology\|technology]] to coordinate varying perspectives. in their practice, they're finding that very often they're able to reach a higher-order synthesis/resolution that qualitatively feels better for people on both sides of the spectrum.

(the [[topics/alchemy/spiritual lineages\|spiritual traditions]] we mentioned before definitely will have some things to say on the nature of [[polarity\|polarity]] as a way to find [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1us’ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/archive/databases/balance/balance\|balance]]/[[harmony\|harmony]] as well 🙃)

there are many people working on [[mediation\|mediation]], [[reconciliation\|reconciliation]], [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss.host\|facilitation]] as a whole, and we might even say that [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1us’ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/archive/databases/sub-interests & practices master list/governance\|governance]] is fundamentally about that. i'll dive more into this on my next article ([[core essays/💭 foundational concepts for developing regenerative information ecologies & empowering knowledge commons\|💭 foundational concepts for developing regenerative information ecologies & empowering knowledge commons]]), but [[initiatives, orgs & communities/design/the society library\|the society library]] is another example of a technology-proposing institution facilitating deeper levels of dialogue/[[concepts/alchemy/sensemaking\|sensemaking]] with their [[argument maps\|argument maps]].

[...]

we can be forever seeking "who has/what is the more comprehensive/coherent/whole approach". so i believe this is more of an individual unfoldment path. the point here isn't to propose a definitive answer, but an evolutionary one.

> how might we shift our way of evaluating a [[topics/alchemy/metaphysics\|metaphysical]] or [[concepts/alchemy/axiology\|axiological]] system, not only by their [[concepts/alchemy/epistemology\|epistemological]] rigour/approach but also by considering, for each individual: *"what works now, in service of what's in my reach, that can support me to continually grow my [[concepts/alchemy/wisdom\|wisdom]] and [[horizon of care\|horizon of care]]?"*

we all came here with different [[_001_MOCs/025 🔷 long game/035 🔭 missions MOC\|missions]], [[concepts/alchemy/needs\|needs]], [[talents\|talents]] and [[_001_MOCs/025 🔷 long game/030 ⛰ challenges & framing MOC\|challenges]]. and while "all paths lead to the tao", not all are equally valuable.

the age-old challenge of [[_003_L1F3/core concepts/self-transformation\|self-transformation]] is as much a work of [[designing\|design]] as of [[discovery\|discovery]] and [[deconstruction\|deconstruction]] ([[tbprocessed/evernote/0 - inbox/ken wilber\|tbprocessed/evernote/0 - inbox/ken wilber]]'s model of the [[models & frameworks/alchemy/four facets of integral development\|four facets of integral development]] do a great job of explaining it in terms of: [[concepts/alchemy/waking up\|waking up]], [[concepts/alchemy/growing up\|growing up]], [[concepts/alchemy/cleaning up\|cleaning up]] and [[concepts/alchemy/showing up\|showing up]]).

![integral dashboard.jpeg](/img/user/images/interfaces%20&%20designs/integral%20dashboard.jpeg)

let's take the [[models & frameworks/alchemy/AQAL map\|AQAL map]] - an [[responses/alchemy/integral theory\|integral theory]] consolidation - as a starting point (the dashboard above). any new discovery becomes just another "tab" or "widget" there, that opens up a whole new rabbit hole of [[discovery\|discovery]] and [[investigation\|investigation]].

-> why integral is so powerful: it provides as close to an agnostic stance as possible (or at least that i've seen) to integrate perspectives and practices. it provides a way of indexing, interpreting and categorizing spiritual (and more - psychological, sociological, scientific) experiences.

if we break down some of the core [[_003_L1F3/core concepts/self-transformation\|self-transformation]] processes, there are: [[concepts/alchemy/consciousness development\|consciousness development]] itself ([[states\|states]] & [[stages\|stages]]), [[psychological development\|psychological development]], [[topics/player/learning\|learning]], [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1us’ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/concepts & frameworks/lines of intelligence\|lines of intelligence]], [[trauma\|trauma]], [[intimacy development\|intimacy development]], [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1us’ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/archive/databases/sub-interests & practices master list/shadow work\|shadow work]], [[parts work\|parts work]], [[flow states\|flow states]], [[concepts/alchemy/non-ordinary states of consciousness\|non-ordinary states of consciousness]], etc...

i favor a modular approach. you don't need to agree with the complete worldview of a certain approach, practice or tradition, but you can practice/experiment with it and develop more depth over time. the point is to gradually explore, learn and incorporate what makes sense for you into your personal systems.

gamers are usually familiar with this idea since they're often tweaking their games with [[DLCs\|DLCs]] or [[mods\|mods]].

##### a meta-systemic approach
