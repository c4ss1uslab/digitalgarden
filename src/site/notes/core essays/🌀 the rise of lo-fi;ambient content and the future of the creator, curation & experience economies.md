we'll talk about shared brains, third spaces, communities...

---

🌀 third spaces / vibecafe.xyz / energy management & resources allocation article:

what it helps with the most:
don't start from scratch -> shared/pre-determined context: music, visuals, language, etc...

⭐️ make distinctions around collective intelligence [spaces / tools / systems] clear, visible, explicit - accessible & persistent.
- esp. for intentionally-designed collaborative spaces

-> shared values + visible resources + mapped ways to create value = enable collaboration

[high-value/high-return activities - trust networks (DAOs/coops) - circular economies]

🚨 issue/challenge: coordination.

enabling it:

💭 subconscious:
TfT / web3 / XR -> semantic, distributed, spatial web

trust/knowledge networks.

knowledge structures -> lists, trees, grids, networks (graphs)

—————-

my curation can be of the utmost value if:

in my writing, i can share/clearly state the insights/learnings i gathered by inhabiting these diverse archetypes/domains of knowledge.

e.g.: present my CEP+R at each article.
-> design nerds: daniel, rieki, vassão, etc
-> builder nerds: sephist, dgardens, etc
-> art: fablab, mdc, domestika, rap geek...

###### context:

my experience of the COVID-19 pandemics was 1 year longer than everyone else. when it struck, i was already on my 11th month isolated from the world.

i was going through some deep emotional healing processes, and found that my only way to cope was to read, meditate, research and ritualize. essentially, for ~3 years, i spent 95% of my time alone, in my room, learning about myself and the world, and rediscovering what moved me.

and this time in physical isolation made reflect and research a lot on the themes of [[belonging\|belonging]], the [[internet\|internet]], [[community building\|community building]] and [[memetic tribes\|memetic tribes]], especially related to the state and the potential of our [[information ecology\|information ecology]] and [[online communities\|online communities]].

in 2023, my life has been pretty much the opposite. going to ecovillages, farms, slums, courses, retreats and all sorts of cultural, local community events in são paulo, brazil.

in this article, i aim to share my findings, curation and perspectives on the [[future of communities\|future of communities]] and the [[internet\|internet]] - and subjacent themes, such as the [[metaverse\|metaverse]], [[trust networks\|trust networks]] and a lot more.

i bring special attention to **[[intentional online communities\|intentional online communities]]** and **[[third spaces\|third spaces]]** as cultural [[attractors\|attractors]]. they're places that can feel more like home than at home or at work.

and how all of this is deeply related to the realizations i had about[[energy management\|energy management]] during this time in isolation.

##### intro

the dilemma of every artist/creator - personal vs economic incentives

###### the magic that is unlocked in community

resonance, possibility.

cherished and encouraged to be your most unique self.

decentralization of resources -> 16x population, 100x resource consumption.

[[market intelligence\|market intelligence]], [[trends\|trends]], [[foresight\|foresight]].

##### creator, curator & experience economies

###### unique potentials and challenges of in-person vs virtual communities

if there's something that persisted even after a lot of western influence and colonization (for its lights and shadows) in the global south culture is that we're a lot more communitarian. everyone is friends, everyone is family.

communities like [[mol\|mol]] and [[instituto amuta\|instituto amuta]] recognize this and are deliberately studying and practicing culture-building in more intentional, conscious and regenerative ways.

###### technology-enabled communities

every technology has values embedded in it.

[[sari azout\|sari]] captures my feelings well when she says:

and for deeper perspectives and practical examples of highly intentional and transformative technologies, check out [this podcast episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcbkdO7mHdY) on building [[collective intelligence tools\|collective intelligence tools]] for [[human alignment\|human alignment]] with [[nicholas brigham\|nicholas brigham]] from [[goodly labs\|goodly labs]].

i will dive into the deep implications of this, but i'll start with the aspects of the creator/experience economy that most people are familiar with.


CEP+N

###### creator communities, online courses, institutional communities

mighty networks, discord, telegram/whatsapp

###### [lofi girl](https://www.youtube.com/@LofiGirl), [the jazz hop café](https://www.youtube.com/@TheJazzHopCafe), - ambient content.
(they're in fact virtual spaces)

- lofi/coffee shops are by far the most popular.
- ASMR, soundscapes, cityscapes
- nature sounds...
- medieval aesthetic, taverns, celtic
- futurist and retro, game soundtracks
- anime aesthetic
- artist-driven like [blue turtle](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRSg-mANRvOGLkV30EyW4jw) or [cosmic resort](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXw4yHjKbl8i2fv6Qba60Kw/)

esports orgs, game guilds, real-life collectives

-> RPGs / MMOs / neopets / LoL...

###### [[m3 metaverse makers\|M3]] - virtual hackerspace & community

[hackerspace]

[XR book]

###### **the stoa** - community-driven spaces -> next instance:

###### **vibecafe.xyz**

leveraging tools like gather to enable communities to be synchronous yet flexible, whisper/chatGPT to generate transcripts/blog posts/mindmaps, capsule.video to do shorts + other tools to promote connection, add serendipity and augment conversations (infranodus, etc).

###### others:
gaoa.network / intentional society / etc...

metaverse folks (VRchat)
-> bluesky example.

creator economy folks, [[metalabel\|metalabel]], DAOs as groups of friends with a treasury

RADAR - future in sync



shared brains (knowledge commons), nature of social media

ultimately, [[sari\|sari]] captures it well here:

for an even deeper understanding, beyond [[distributed cognition\|distributed cognition]], we can also have [[augmented intelligence\|augmented intelligence]] with [[AI agents\|AI agents]], [[visualizations\|visualizations]], and more.

[moving castles](https://trust.support/feed/moving-castles) is a pioneer work on this field, [[moritz bierling\|moritz bierling]] also shares [a rich conceptual understanding of the space](https://twitter.com/bierlingm/status/1274362866750160896), which influenced my own understanding and experimentation with [[secondary minds\|secondary minds]].
