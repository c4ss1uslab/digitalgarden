more commonly known as simply: the [[concepts/alchemy/waking up\|waking up]], [[concepts/alchemy/growing up\|growing up]], [[concepts/alchemy/cleaning up\|cleaning up]] and [[concepts/alchemy/showing up\|showing up]] model. (sometimes also: [[concepts/alchemy/opening up\|opening up]])

it states that [[concepts/alchemy/human development\|human development]] happens across 4 different dimensions, and shows how our different modalities of [[topics/alchemy/spirituality\|spirituality]], [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1usâ€™ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/archive/databases/industries master list/psychology\|psychology]], [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1usâ€™ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/archive/databases/superskills master list/philosophy\|philosophy]], [[therapeutic modalities\|therapeutic modalities]], etc tend to focus on just one of them.
