a good introductory article: https://medium.com/age-of-awareness/a-metamodern-guide-to-human-development-49fe8d8f0e8f

"state, code, stage, depth" is a framework for understanding [[concepts/alchemy/human development\|human development]], proposed by [[people/references/alchemy/hanzi freinacht\|hanzi freinacht]] in the [[_009_notes & highlights from books, videos, articles/listening society\|listening society]] book.

while it's heavily influenced by [[models & frameworks/design/four quadrants\|ken wilber's four quadrants]]‚Åπ‚Å∂ and the [[models & frameworks/alchemy/AQAL\|AQAL model]]‚Åπ‚Åµ, i believe this framework is way more accessible than them. no need to go into any kind of metaphysical territory. i find it the best/clearer introduction/definition of [[concepts/alchemy/human development\|human development]] without needing to discuss [[concepts/alchemy/energy work\|woo]].
