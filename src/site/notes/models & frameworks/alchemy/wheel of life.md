##### about

a famous coaching tool that breaks down your life into 8-12 major areas. it usually is applied by asking you to evaluate how well you believe each area is doing (1-10), and how you'd like them to be in the future (short, mid, long term), recognizing that it's very difficult to achieve "balance" between all of them. it can help see pain points and clarify priorities to come up with any sort of plan/strategy.
