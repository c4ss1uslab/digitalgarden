the AQAL map (below) presents the [[models & frameworks/alchemy/AQAL\|AQAL framework]] in a single image, though it might be hard to get for beginners.

the shortest introduction to the subject i'd recommend is [[initiatives, orgs & communities/alchemy/integral life\|integral life]]'s ["what is the integral approach?"](https://integrallife.com/what-is-integral-approach/), so you can actually understand and appreciate the framework, its elements and their studies/sources.
