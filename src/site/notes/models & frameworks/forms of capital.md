this framework was created by [[ethan roland\|ethan roland]] & [[gregory landua\|gregory landua]] in 2011, from their research on financial [[tbprocessed/base notes/topics/permaculture\|permaculture]]. see a great introductory post [here](http://www.appleseedpermaculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/8_Forms_of_Capital_PM68.pdf).
