### Informational Constructs

In an age dominated by data and connectivity, we often overlook the fundamental structures that shape our societies, guide our interactions, and power our technologies. These structures, which we can call "Informational Constructs," form the invisible architecture of our world. They encompass everything from social norms and legal systems to computer algorithms and communication protocols. Understanding Informational Constructs is crucial for comprehending the complex systems that govern our lives and for designing better solutions to societal and technological challenges.

## What are Informational Constructs? 

Informational Constructs are organized systems of information that guide behavior, decision-making, and the flow of resources in human-technological systems. They form the "I" in the [MEI Model](https://diome.xyz/2+%F0%9F%8C%BF+Leaves/MEI+Model) of technology.

Informational constructs exist on a spectrum from highly formalized and explicit (like computer code or legal statutes) to implicit and culturally embedded (like social norms or linguistic structures). These constructs are not physical entities but rather patterns of information that shape how we think, interact, and organize our world.

## Foundations of Informational Constructs 

> _In this sense, politics, when organized, is also a kind of technology: the framework of communication and processing which governs everyday interaction and possibility._ [Ways of Being - Animals, Plants, Machines](https://diome.xyz/Ways+of+Being+-+Animals%2C+Plants%2C+Machines)

The concept of informational constructs emerges from the recognition of common patterns across various fields:

1. Information Technologies: These are the digital systems we typically associate with modern technology. At their core, these technologies process, store, and transmit data using binary code, algorithms, and protocols. The internet, operating systems, apps, and databases are all manifestations of the "soft" side of information technologies.
2. Social Technologies: These are the methods and systems humans have developed to organize societies and facilitate collective action. They include legal systems, economic markets, educational institutions, and governance structures. For instance, a democratic voting system is a social technology that uses structured information (ballots, voter rolls) to make collective decisions.
3. [Psychotechnologies](https://youtu.be/237-jbJfleY): These are tools and techniques designed to influence human cognition, emotion, and behavior. They range from ancient practices like meditation and rhetoric to modern approaches like cognitive behavioral therapy and advertising. Even language itself can be considered a fundamental psychotechnology, shaping how we think and perceive the world.

While these domains may seem distinct, they all fundamentally rely on structured information to function. A legal code, a computer program, and a meditation technique are all, at their core, systems of organized information that guide behavior and decision-making.

The boundaries between these domains are increasingly blurring. Social media platforms, for example, are information technologies that function as social technologies and incorporate psychotechnological elements in their design. Similarly, blockchain technologies merge aspects of information technology with social and economic systems.

The concept of informational constructs provides a unified framework to analyze and design across these interconnected domains.

## Types of Informational Constructs 

While not exhaustive, here are some key types of informational constructs:

1. [Protocols](https://diome.xyz/2+%F0%9F%8C%BF+Leaves/Protocols): Formal rules governing communication and interaction
    - Examples: TCP/IP, diplomatic protocols, social etiquette
2. [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1us’ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/concepts & frameworks/roles/roles\|Roles]]: Defined positions within a system with associated expectations
    - Examples: Job titles, social roles (parent, teacher), user roles in software
3. [[Software\|Software]]: Coded instructions for computer operations
    - Examples: Operating systems, applications, algorithms
4. [[Narratives\|Narratives]]: Stories and explanations that shape understanding and behavior
    - Examples: Cultural myths, corporate visions, personal life stories
5. [[Techniques\|Techniques]]: Specific methods for accomplishing tasks
    - Examples: Scientific methods, manufacturing processes, problem-solving strategies
6. [[tbprocessed/evernote/2 - in progress/languages\|Languages]]: Systems of symbols for communication
    - Examples: Natural languages, programming languages, sign languages
7. [[Frameworks\|Frameworks]]: Structured approaches for organizing information or activities
    - Examples: Legal frameworks, project management methodologies, theoretical models
8. [[Rituals\|Rituals]]: Prescribed sequences of actions with symbolic meaning
    - Examples: Religious ceremonies, corporate onboarding, daily routines
9. [[topics/lab/algorithms\|Algorithms]]: Step-by-step procedures for calculations or problem-solving
    - Examples: Sorting algorithms, recommendation systems, decision trees
10. [[Norms\|Norms]]: Informal rules governing behavior within a group
    - Examples: Cultural norms, professional ethics, online community guidelines

The concept of informational constructs provides a unified framework to describe the information/knowledge aspects of interconnected systems. It allows us to analyze and design across traditional boundaries, recognizing that whether we're dealing with a computer protocol, a social ritual, or a mental technique, we're essentially working with structured information that guides behavior and decision-making.
