##### a few personal notes/reflections on it:

the way i've been referring to metadesign most often is by pointing to a few fundamental questions:

> "what are the systems at the foundations of our reality? be them personal, social, civilizational, metaphysical or biophysical? and how are they currently designed, based upon which values, principles and towards what ends?"

i.e. an inquiry into what [[meta-systems\|meta-systems]] really exist and how they work.

the practice of metadesign, in this sense - attempts to create space for experiencing life fully ([[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1us‚Äô notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/archive/databases/general skills master list/aesthetics\|aesthetics]]) - with no pre-conceived labels ([[taxonomy\|taxonomy]]), to help us more deeply relate to, understand and define what exists ([[concepts/alchemy/ontology\|ontology]]) - at the same time that it constantly asks and creates: how can we design supportive conditions for emergence? ([[terms/cosmology\|cosmology]], in a sense, and metadesign - in practice)

it's a set of systems/attitudes for relating to and understanding the contexts in which we live/we're embedded in, and which movements make the most sense from our position.

[[people/references/architect;design/caio vass√£o\|caio vass√£o]] seems to be doing it in a very similar way, but seeing and tending to this an emergent academic and practical field - based on an approach and set of tools for (meta)designing complex systems. it drinks from several [[people/references/architect;design/caio vass√£o#^38761d\|sources]] as an attempt to build a deeply [[terms/collaboration\|collaborative]], [[topics/design/systems\|systems]]-informed yet abstract, generic approach to design.

it does point to some of the macro reflections that i referred to, especially through the [[models & frameworks/design/metadesign#^2adcd5\|metagame framework/application]] and in its multidisciplinary academic background via caio's lectures, 

i'm still understanding its context and applicability, gauging the depth and effectiveness of its impact. it seems to lack focus on [[responses/design/values-based design\|values-centered design]] and individual [[concepts/alchemy/human development\|human development]], as well putting [[responses/regen/regenerative design\|regenerative design]] and [[concepts/alchemy/decolonization\|decolonial theory]] on secondary seat, but perhaps that's what's also needed to navigate and influence institutions deeply rooted in [[concepts/design/modernity\|modern]], [[diagnosis/accumulation, extraction, abstraction\|extractivist]] paradigms.

the way it has been able to penetrate culture as primarily a "facilitation method" and a set of key ideas/tools/distinctions, driving (some) transformation in corporate and public sectors in brazil is intriguing, so i'm currently learning more about it.

##### different uses

the term has different applications and methodologies, the one i'm currently learning more about (and which seems the most structured and tested from all of them) is an approach developed by [[people/references/architect;design/caio vass√£o\|caio vass√£o]] for designing [[concepts/design/complex systems\|complex systems]] (in portuguese).

other notable researchers/approaches are: [[john wood\|john wood]], [[gehrard fischer\|gehrard fischer]], [[people/references/architect;design/carlo franzato\|carlo franzato]].

##### talk on building a regenerative society

innovation should be attached to regeneration. and vice-versa.
![](https://i.imgur.com/mn7cjpj.jpeg)

in order to do so, we need to recognize that "sustainability" isn't a specialized area, it's transversal. innovation should also be.
![](https://i.imgur.com/d7QzLQt.jpeg)

innovating based on ecosystem maps (dynamic landscapes):
![](https://i.imgur.com/oIHFSgv.jpeg)

operating at the right level of abstraction requires mapping ecosystems at the right level. neither too many details:
![](https://i.imgur.com/3C7QnMe.jpeg)

nor too little:
![](https://i.imgur.com/G4Rqm3a.jpeg)

an organizational ecosystems map is an important artefact - one that should be constantly tended to:
![mapa de ecossistemas - vass√£o](https://i.imgur.com/Wiki9BV.png)
(reminds me a lot of a [[models & frameworks/design/wardley mapping\|wardley map]])

the metadesign & facilitation frameworks enable that regenerative innovation frame to be spread/adopted organization-wide.
![](https://i.imgur.com/hOObeQo.jpeg)

regeneration presumes evolving, living systems, and therefore requires an ecosystemic/ecologic view. it's not about seeing "everything", but seeing "enough":
