##### a few personal notes/reflections on it:

the way i refer to metadesign and use it most often is as aiming to answer: "what are the systems at the foundation of our reality? personal, social, civilizational, metaphysical and biophysical? and how are they designed currently, based upon which values, principles and towards what ends?"

the practice of metadesign for me, helps to delineate, define what is - at the same time that it creates space for experiencing life fully - with no labels - and then start to realize the emergence of order amidst apparent chaos.

it's an attitude/system for understanding the contexts in which we live/we're embedded in, and which movements make sense from our position.

examples/applications in other references/my own work: [[relevance realization\|relevance realization]], [[latent space mapping\|latent space mapping]], [[omnimapping\|omnimapping]]...

##### different uses

the term has different applications and methodologies, the one i'm currently learning more about (and which seems the most structured and tested from all of them) is an approach developed by [[people/references/architect;design/caio vassão\|caio vassão]] for designing [[concepts/design/complex systems\|complex systems]] (in portuguese).

it drinks from several thinkers, philosophers and practitioners in order to build a [[post-colonial\|post-colonial]], [[responses/regen/regenerative design\|regenerative]] yet generic approach to design.

other notable researchers/approaches are: [[john wood\|john wood]], [[gehrard fischer\|gehrard fischer]], [[people/references/architect;design/carlo franzato\|carlo franzato]].

##### talk on building a regenerative society

innovation should be attached to regeneration. and vice-versa.
![](https://i.imgur.com/mn7cjpj.jpeg)

in order to do so, we need to recognize that "sustainability" isn't a specialized area, it's transversal. innovation should also be.
![](https://i.imgur.com/d7QzLQt.jpeg)

innovating based on ecosystem maps (dynamic landscapes):
![](https://i.imgur.com/oIHFSgv.jpeg)

operating at the right level of abstraction requires mapping ecosystems at the right level. neither too many details:
![](https://i.imgur.com/3C7QnMe.jpeg)

nor too little:
![](https://i.imgur.com/G4Rqm3a.jpeg)

an organizational ecosystems map is an important artefact - one that should be constantly tended to:
![mapa de ecossistemas - vassão](https://i.imgur.com/Wiki9BV.png)
(reminds me a lot of a [[models & frameworks/design/wardley mapping\|wardley map]])

the metadesign & facilitation frameworks enable that regenerative innovation frame to be spread/adopted organization-wide.

regeneration presumes evolving, living systems, and therefore requires an ecosystemic/ecologic view. it's not about seeing "everything", but seeing "enough":
