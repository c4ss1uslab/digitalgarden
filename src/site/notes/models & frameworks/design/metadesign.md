the contents of the writing below are a bit complex, relying upon a previous understanding of a few information-dense words. don't be discouraged. if you aren't familiarized with a few of the terms i use, the links throughout the text expand on it more. i encourage you to read the page below, explore a few of the references i link to and come back to re-read it after some time. it should get much clearer for you.

##### a few personal notes/reflections on it:

the way i've been referring to metadesign most often is by pointing to a few fundamental questions:

> "what are the systems at the foundations of our reality? be them personal, social, civilizational, metaphysical or biophysical? and how are they currently designed, based upon which values, principles and towards what ends?"

i.e. an inquiry into what [[meta-systems\|meta-systems]] really exist and how they work.

the practice of metadesign, in this sense - attempts to create space for experiencing life fully ([[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1us’ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/archive/databases/general skills master list/aesthetics\|aesthetics]]) - with no pre-conceived labels ([[taxonomy\|taxonomy]]), to help us more deeply relate to, understand and define what exists ([[concepts/alchemy/ontology\|ontology]]) - at the same time that it constantly asks and creates: how can we design supportive conditions for emergence? ([[terms/cosmology\|cosmology]], in a sense, and metadesign - in practice)

it's a set of systems/attitudes for relating to and understanding the contexts in which we live/we're embedded in, and which movements make the most sense from our position.

[[people/references/architect;design/caio vassão\|caio vassão]] seems to be doing it in a very similar way, but seeing and tending to this an emergent academic and practical field - based on an approach and set of tools for (meta)designing complex systems. it drinks from several [[people/references/architect;design/caio vassão#^38761d\|sources]] as an attempt to build a deeply [[terms/collaboration\|collaborative]], [[topics/design/systems\|systems]]-informed yet abstract, generic approach to design.

i'm still unsure about the depth and effectiveness of its impact, considering its lack of focus on [[responses/design/values-based design\|values-centered design]] and individual [[concepts/alchemy/human development\|human development]], as well as the secondary seat that [[responses/regen/regenerative design\|regenerative design]] and [[concepts/alchemy/decolonization\|decolonial theory]] take, but perhaps that's what's needed to navigate and influence institutions deeply rooted in [[concepts/design/modernity\|modern]], [[diagnosis/accumulation, extraction, abstraction\|extractivist]] paradigms.

the way it has been able to penetrate culture as primarily a "facilitation method", plus a set of key ideas/tools/distinctions and drive (some) transformation in corporate and public sectors in brazil is intriguing, so i'm currently learning more about it.

examples/applications of metadesign in my own work: [[patterns/active patterns/knowledge design/relevance score\|relevance scores]] and other [[patterns/pattern collections/knowledge design patterns\|knowledge design patterns]], [[_003_L1F3/L1F3 support systems\|L1F3 support systems]] design.

##### different uses

the term has different applications and methodologies, the one i'm currently learning more about (and which seems the most structured and tested from all of them) is an approach developed by [[people/references/architect;design/caio vassão\|caio vassão]] for designing [[concepts/design/complex systems\|complex systems]] (in portuguese).

other notable researchers/approaches are: [[john wood\|john wood]], [[gehrard fischer\|gehrard fischer]], [[people/references/architect;design/carlo franzato\|carlo franzato]].

##### talk on building a regenerative society

innovation should be attached to regeneration. and vice-versa.
![](https://i.imgur.com/mn7cjpj.jpeg)

in order to do so, we need to recognize that "sustainability" isn't a specialized area, it's transversal. innovation should also be.
![](https://i.imgur.com/d7QzLQt.jpeg)

innovating based on ecosystem maps (dynamic landscapes):
![](https://i.imgur.com/oIHFSgv.jpeg)

operating at the right level of abstraction requires mapping ecosystems at the right level. neither too many details:
![](https://i.imgur.com/3C7QnMe.jpeg)

nor too little:
![](https://i.imgur.com/G4Rqm3a.jpeg)

an organizational ecosystems map is an important artefact - one that should be constantly tended to:
![mapa de ecossistemas - vassão](https://i.imgur.com/Wiki9BV.png)
(reminds me a lot of a [[models & frameworks/design/wardley mapping\|wardley map]])

the metadesign & facilitation frameworks enable that regenerative innovation frame to be spread/adopted organization-wide.
![](https://i.imgur.com/hOObeQo.jpeg)

regeneration presumes evolving, living systems, and therefore requires an ecosystemic/ecologic view. it's not about seeing "everything", but seeing "enough":

to global north countries (declining metropolis) and global south countries (ex-colonies) providing and receiving both.
