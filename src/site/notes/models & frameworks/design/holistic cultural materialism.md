cultural materialism was a framework proposed by [[people/references/architect;design/marvin harris\|marvin harris]] for conceptualizing the major areas of society/[[_004_L1F3/core concepts/civilization design\|civilization design]]. it consists of: [[concepts/design/superstructure\|superstructure]], [[social structure\|social structure]], [[concepts/design/infrastructure\|infrastructure]].

[[people/references/architect;design/andrea faria\|andrea faria]] has a great introduction and expansion of it, calling it: [Holistic Cultural Materialism](https://diome.xyz/2+%F0%9F%8C%BF+Leaves/Cultural+Materialism), introducing the biological systems we're also part of. check it out.

i find it a very useful reference for clarifying what are the civilizational [[topics/architect;design/systems\|systems]] we've built and that we're part of.
