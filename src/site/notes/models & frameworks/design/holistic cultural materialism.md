##### context

cultural materialism was a framework proposed by [[people/references/architect;design/marvin harris\|marvin harris]] for conceptualizing the major areas of society/[[_003_L1F3/core concepts/civilization design\|civilization design]]. it consists of: [[concepts/design/superstructure\|superstructure]], [[social structure\|social structure]], [[concepts/design/infrastructure\|infrastructure]].

[[people/references/architect;design/andrea farias\|andrea farias]] provided a great introduction and proposes an expansion of it, calling it: [Holistic Cultural Materialism](https://diome.xyz/2+%F0%9F%8C%BF+Leaves/Cultural+Materialism), emphasizing the biological systems we're also part of.

i find it a very useful reference for clarifying what are the civilizational [[topics/design/systems\|systems]] we've built and that we're part of.

##### framework

i.e. _(andrea's updates are in bold)_

"I propose an expanded theory I'll call Holistic Cultural Materialism, in which the development and characteristics of civilizations are understood as emerging from the complex interactions between six interconnected elements:

- Infrastructure: The material base of a society, including its technologies, economic systems, and modes of production and reproduction.

- Structure: The social, political, and economic institutions that organize and regulate human activities and relationships.

- Superstructure: The cultural beliefs, values, practices, and symbolic systems that shape individual and collective consciousness and behavior.

- **Physiologic Structure**: The biological and psychological dimensions of human existence, including human bodies, brains, and behaviors, as well as the environmental factors that influence them.

- **Multi-Species Structure**: The networks of relationships and interactions between human societies and other species, including the ways in which humans depend on, co-evolve with, and impact the lives of other organisms.

- **Planetary Structure**: The Earth's ecosystems, biogeochemical cycles, and climate system, which provide the fundamental life-support systems for all species and shape the conditions for the development of civilizations."
