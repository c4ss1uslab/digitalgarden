#### about

what's the difference between a "relevance score" vs an [[importance\|importance]] rating, as seen in [[gwern\|gwern]]'s website, for example?

in [gwern's own words](https://gwern.net/about#importance-tags):

> Using [my interactive sorting tool Resorter](/resorter), Iâ€™ve ranked pages in deciles from 0â€“10 on how important the topic is to myself, the intended reader, or the world. For example, topics like [embryo selection for traits such as intelligence](https://gwern.net/embryo-selection) or [evolutionary pressures towards autonomous AI](https://gwern.net/tool-ai) are vastly more important, and be ranked 10, than some poems or a dream or someoneâ€™s small [nootropics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nootropic) self-experiment, which would be ranked 0â€“1.

at face value, this makes sense, but what if that poem, dream, or nootropics experiment turns out to make an impact on you and become a major experience in your life? something that started with a low apparent importance can grow and become something else.

that's why i call it relevance. it's more fleeting, contextual. what's important today (getting a job, making ends meet) might be completely unimportant in a different context (when you're financially stable and are dealing with family/emotional challenges). both at an individual level (like in the example i gave), but also at a societal level.

when i use "relevance", i'm pointing to the cognitive process of [[recursive relevance realization\|recursive relevance realization]], which we're always engaged in, re-evaluating *what is relevant now, and why*.

if something tends to *stay relevant for a long time*, it's likely something important for us. if it seems super important at some point, but after some time it loses its grip on us, how important was it really? or was it just pointing to something deeper, that's more important to us?

*i.e.* relevance is more short-term. importance is more long-term. importance can be (sort of) measure by how relevant something stays for you over time.

well, that's my perspective. it's a starting point. more nuance needed/welcome over time as we continue to use this pattern. :)

#### relevance score map

i still have to figure out why the [digital garden plugin](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/) i'm using isn't allowing me to pass frontmatter through, so the relevance score isn't showing on my notes. i currently have 42 notes with assigned relevance scores, and slowly adding it to more and more of them.

i intend to fix this soon, but in the meantime, here's a useful visualization:
