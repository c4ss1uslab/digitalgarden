see: https://maggieappleton.com/epistemic-disclosure

in simple words, how much "certainty" i have over this content and/or a measure of how much it has been tested/validated according to different epistemic methods ([[positivist\|positivist]]/[[interpretivist\|interpretivist]]/[[pragmatist\|pragmatist]] scientific methods, [[concepts/alchemy/anthro-ontological method\|anthro-ontology]], etc).

essentially, a confidence level/rating.
