knowledge design includes: [[knowledge development\|knowledge development]], [[topics/lab/knowledge management\|knowledge management]] and [[knowledge presentation\|knowledge presentation]]:

i spent a great deal of time over the past ~9 years trying to figure out best practices for managing my own knowledge, as well as sharing it with people and building knowledge collaboratively.

this page contains both a philosophical and technical exploration (however brief and incomplete) of the design patterns i have been applying and finding the most useful/relevant.

i'm attempting to implement these patterns to both my [[_000_digital garden/c4ss1us' garden\|digital garden]] and the [[_003_research/00 - viable pathways book-zine\|viable pathways book-zine]] i'm working on, so you can see them in action there.

###### more patterns:

dynamic possibility/fitness landscapes (+ climate) - see https://subconscious.substack.com/p/fragments-attractors & https://baku89.com/2021/01/10/fitness-landscape

dynamic interfaces (generated via web/scraper/agent data + second brain information + pre-set frameworks)
-> maps
-> diagrams (e.g.: https://diagram.website/)
-> codex

[[daily notes\|daily notes]] + "order by recent" -> apply to bookmarks as well

\+ relevant mental models:

more knowledge/distinctions lead to more knowledge/distinctions, which cause self-amplifying returns but can be class-perpetuating, not necessarily exponential.
