knowledge design includes: [[knowledge development\|knowledge development]], [[topics/lab/knowledge management\|knowledge management]] and [[knowledge presentation\|knowledge presentation]]:

i spent a great deal of time over the past ~9 years trying to figure out best practices for managing my own knowledge, as well as sharing it with people and building knowledge collaboratively.

this page contains both a philosophical and technical exploration (however brief and incomplete) of the design patterns i have been applying and finding the most useful/relevant.

i'm attempting to implement these patterns to both my [[_000_digital garden/c4ss1us' garden\|digital garden]] and the [[_003_research/00 - viable pathways book-zine\|viable pathways book-zine]] i'm working on, so you can see them in action there.

\+ relevant mental models:

more knowledge/distinctions lead to more knowledge/distinctions, which cause self-amplifying returns but can be class-perpetuating, not necessarily exponential.
