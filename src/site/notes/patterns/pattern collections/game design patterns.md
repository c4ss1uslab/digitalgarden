##### intro

it can be argued that in the field of [[topics/player/game design\|game design]] there are no consolidated "game design patterns", as it's more widely adopted by [architects](https://patternlanguage.cc/), [designers](https://maggieappleton.com/patterns) and [software engineers](https://gordonbrander.com/pattern/). however, there are proposals/compilations made by [staffan bjork & jussi holopainen's "patterns in game design"](http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Category:Patterns) (2004), [joris dormans's discussions on it](https://pure.hva.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/141730/556198_Dissertatie_Dormans.pdf) (2012), [jose zagal's "game ontology"](https://www.gameontology.com/index.php/Main_Page) (2020), [christopher barney's "pattern language for game design"](https://patternlanguageforgamedesign.com/PatternLibraryApp/PatternLibrary/) (2021) that offer different approaches and are very useful references.

instead of having a long list of "best practices" and "common problems to be solved", the approach/patterns that tend to work well in one context/kind of game, might be the opposite for a different one. applying certain patterns or not to a game depends a lot on the creative direction.

nonetheless, there are some commonly seen patterns and threads amongst the researchers i mentioned. the first wiki i mentioned - [bjork and holopainen's "patterns in game design"](http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Category:Patterns) and their initial pattern categorization is a great starting point. it also has a [great support tool for visual navigation](https://gdpv.is/).

a few patterns i'd like to highlight are the [interface patterns](http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Category:Interface_Patterns) and the ones i implemented as part of the [[_002_toolkit/000 ⛓ l1f3 player toolkit\|l1f3 player toolkit]].

websites like [[projects & tools/tools/player/game UI database\|game UI database]] and [[projects & tools/tools/player/interface in game\|interface in game]] also help with visualizing the most up-to-date/state of the art applications of some of these patterns.
