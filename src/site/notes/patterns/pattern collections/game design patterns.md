##### intro

in the field of [[topics/player/game design\|game design]] there are no consolidated "[[patterns/pattern collections/game design patterns\|game design patterns]]", as it's much more popular with [architects](https://patternlanguage.cc/), [designers](https://maggieappleton.com/patterns) and [software engineers](https://gordonbrander.com/pattern/), however there are proposals and compilations made by [staffan bjork & jussi holopainen's "patterns in game design"](http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/index.php/Main_Page) (2004), [joris dormans's discussions on it](https://pure.hva.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/141730/556198_Dissertatie_Dormans.pdf) (2012), [jose zagal's "game ontology"](https://www.gameontology.com/index.php/Main_Page) (2020), [christopher barney's "pattern language for game design"](https://patternlanguageforgamedesign.com/PatternLibraryApp/PatternLibrary/) (2021) that are very useful references.

websites like [[projects & tools/tools/player/game UI database\|game UI database]] and [[projects & tools/tools/player/interface in game\|interface in game]] also help with visualizing the most up-to-date/state of the art applications of such patterns.
