as of october 12th, 2024, they're my #7 most listened artist of all-time with 1,134 plays, as tracked on [[projects & tools/tools/music/last.fm\|last.fm]].

similar to [[references/music/artists/those who ride with giants\|those who ride with giants]], i find their sound way more chill than most [[instrumental post-rock\|instrumental post-rock]] songs, and though way more focused on guitar sounds than the predominant progressive low-tempo drums of those who ride with giants, they can create a uniquely introspective mood as well.

my favorites playlist: [black hill - spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4WEGkZJApzLQJilhANxtf6?si=f809b8e70f6e4a7f)
