as of october 12th, 2024, they're my #4 most listened artist of all-time with 1,379 plays, as tracked on [[projects & tools/tools/music/last.fm\|last.fm]].

i find the genre of [[instrumental post-rock\|instrumental post-rock]] conceptually very interesting, but often times too aggressive for my taste. as precisely a [[post-rock\|post-rock]] artist, i find those who ride with giants' sound is incredibly spacious, harmonic, light and beautiful/coherent in their construction.

it's perfect for taking a shower, daydreaming, working on something inspirational or meditating/connecting more deeply with any feelings.

my favorites playlist: [those who ride with giants - spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1bxWYeC3fmYKXvV8WLMZff?si=1947797625b94d63)

they also have created/shared a cool playlist containing - in their own words - [a small collection of wonderful moods & emotions to soften the wayward path of life](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1UMZGWYhvwEphzwDC0VyUW?si=8348f54ff9854aa7).
