a wonderful group of pro and amateur musicians studying and performing ethno/[[topics/art/world music\|world music]], led by [[people/references/music/gabriel levy\|gabriel levy]] and [[rita braga\|rita braga]] in s√£o paulo. i was very fortunate to be part of it in the second semester of 2024.

the maestro, [[people/references/music/gabriel levy\|gabriel levy]] is a prolific musician, educator and researcher, associated with several other world music projects: [[mawaca\|mawaca]], [[yaman trio\|yaman trio]], [[mutrib\|mutrib]], traditional japanese ensembles, and tangential relationships with such as: [[responses/art/m√∫sica do c√≠rculo\|m√∫sica do c√≠rculo]], [[orquestra mundana refugi\|orquestra mundana refugi]] and more. [[rita braga\|rita]], the group's vocal trainer, is also a part of [[mawaca\|mawaca]].

the shows are truly spectacles (50+ musicians), involving traditional dances and the invitation to listen with open ears to what might be outside of our understanding of mainstream music (and even the genre of [[folk music\|folk music]] itself). as in gabriel's words: "if you can't help, get in the way! what's important is to get involved." :)

it emphasizes the ancestral songs of resistance and love from refugees, indigenous peoples and other groups that have been systemically persecuted with [[colonialism\|colonialism]] and the perpetuity of [[concepts/design/modernity\|modernity]].

#### resources:

a 30-min documentary (portuguese with english subs): [a magn√≠fica orchestra's doc](https://youtu.be/FkRfJO6lkHo).

a few of the songs are available on the [orchestra's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@amagnificaorchestrademusic1258), but if you're like me and want to check out a full show to get a feel for it, one of the participants, lauri, [records some of them](https://www.youtube.com/@LauriZancanaro/featured) (though not in the highest-quality audio possible, check out his playlists). i participated in [this presentation on the 1st of december](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOHXYTkVCjU), right before my birthday. :)

the conductor's masters' thesis (in portuguese), also accounts his experience with the orchestra and introduces several reflections on themes such as [[identity\|identity]], [[authenticity\|authenticity]], [[decolonialism\|decolonialism]], [[interculturality\|interculturality]] and [[music education\|music education]]: [world music in educational processes](https://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/27/27158/tde-31082021-195045/publico/GabrielJoseLevy.pdf).
