#### about

[anirap](https://www.youtube.com/@AniRap) is a young brazilian artist, that creates [[topics/art/brazilian nerdcore\|brazilian nerdcore]] music. in my opinion, he excels at interpreting characters, and especially on [[psychopaths\|psychopaths]], he's unparalleled. his aggressive style shines the most on his fast flows and powerful drives on high notes. most of his songs have a frenetic mix of [[electronic\|electronic]], [[rap\|rap]]/[[trap\|trap]] and [[rock\|rock]] elements, but a few of them are more chill and danceable too (higuruma, hanma, mitsuya). i really like him.
