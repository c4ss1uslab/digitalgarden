a really funny/cool standard power progression narrative, set in a world in which [[VR\|VR]] [[topics/player/gaming\|gaming]] has taken over.

**reflections from reading:**

something really unique about its [[topics/lab/artificial intelligence\|AI]]/skill system is that by the players' actions determine the development of adaptive abilities (i.e. what you train, you get good at, but not so much in a linear, pre-determined fashion. if you find creative ways to use your skills, the system will reward you creatively as well). but what's even more interesting is that this also affects others (NPCs and players). what players do to support/oppress others can also trigger them to develop new skills/unfold their potential in new, unique ways.

e.g. soldiers with a unique talent being harnessed/supported to develop that. [[asmophel\|asmophel]], [[piaro\|piaro]], the old blacksmith dude...
