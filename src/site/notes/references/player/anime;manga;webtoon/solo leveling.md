one of the most successful [[topics/player/webtoons\|webtoons]] of all time. it burst the bubble and introduced the manhwa scene to many [[topics/player/anime\|anime]]/[[manga\|manga]] fans. it got its own ongoing anime adaptation in 2023.

it isn't that deep of a story, very standard [[topics/art/progression fantasy\|progression fantasy]] tropes, but the overall concept of an [[isekai\|isekai]]-like [[topics/player/gaming\|gaming]] world is definitely attractive, and the art style of both the [[topics/player/webtoons\|webtoon]] and the [[topics/player/anime\|anime]] adaptation are fantastic. fun, worth it.
