amazing article/presentation on the history of the term and field of "[[responses/lab/tools for thought\|tools for thought]]", establishing a few important distinctions. essential to anyone thinking about [[topics/design/anthropology\|anthropology]], [[cognitive science\|cognitive science]], [[concepts/design/technology design\|technology design]] and [[topics/lab/technology development\|development]].

i recommend the article version because it goes into more depth on a few of the references, including a part labeled as "draft", with more great loose thoughts and references.
