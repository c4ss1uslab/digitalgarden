integral OS was an audio course launched by [[initiatives, orgs & communities/alchemy/integral life\|integral life]] in the early 2000s based on [[people/references/alchemy/ken wilber\|ken wilber]]'s work on [[responses/alchemy/integral theory\|integral theory]]. they also came up with the speculative interface visualization below (which i call the [[integral dashboard\|integral dashboard]]) and the [[AQAL map\|AQAL map]].

understanding it provides a good understanding of what having a "meta-OS" / "meta-framework" for self-management feels like, so it's a great source/reference for talking about the [[_004_L1F3/l1f3 operating system\|l1f3 OS]].

i did get access to the files and followed the program for a few weeks, but it was very introductory, so if you're interested in getting into it, i maintain the recommendations i made on the [[responses/alchemy/integral theory\|integral theory]] page.
