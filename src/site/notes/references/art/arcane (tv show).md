https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcane_(TV_series)

the show touched me on many levels. one reason is because i've been a [[league of legends\|league of legends]] player since i was 14 years old, and it's inspired by league's universe. but it can be watched and understood by anyone.

second because the major quality i find in the shows i resonate with (especially [[topics/player/anime\|anime]]) is that they often can take me when i'm in a melancholic, low-energy mood and transform it into something beautiful. it connects me with depths i'm not accessing on my own (whether through [[practices/meditation\|meditation]] or other [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1usâ€™ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/archive/databases/sub-programs master list/emotional well-being practices/therapy\|therapeutic]]/[[concepts/alchemy/healing\|healing]] practices) and gives me perspective and inspiration.

this happens very beautifully here with one of the main character's story (not gonna spoil it here), alongside the complexity of the plot that reflects real life on so many levels, often hard to put into words. plus, incredibly beautiful art style and psychedelic representations.

i recommend watching at least 3 episodes at a time, since they're connected in an arc, and i believe the series takes some time (the end of the first arc) to make a statement for itself - to show up why it exists.

they also created really good behind the scenes series showing the artistic/development process: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbAFXJC0J5GYEkfxnGTWnvgcEypgBeAb5
