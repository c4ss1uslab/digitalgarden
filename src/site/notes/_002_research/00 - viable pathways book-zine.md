#### about

the viable pathways book-zine is a *research-in-development publication* that covers a wide range of topics, exploring different [[concepts/lab/dynamic medium\|media formats]] and [[design patterns\|design patterns]] for more nuanced understanding and effective learning.

fundamentally, it's an inquiry into [[post capitalist systems\|post capitalist systems]] and [[concepts/alchemy/ways of being\|ways of being]]:

> how can we create systems that enable us to conceive [[concepts/alchemy/thriving\|thrivable]] societies, playing, coordinating and collaborating towards more, [[sacred\|sacred]], [[topics/design/regeneration\|regenerative]] and resilient presents & futures?

there is a myriad of different perspectives and research on the complex [[human predicament\|human predicament]] we're in, often called the [[anthropocene\|anthropocene]], [[concepts/design/polycrisis\|polycrisis]] and the [[concepts/design/metacrisis\|metacrisis]]. and even where there's some agreement amongst these views, there is often divergence on what to do/how to move beyond it.

for the past 7 years i've been navigating this space, aiming to clarify: **what are these different perspectives, what are their theories of change, how do they converge & diverge, and could they be complementary?**

the goal of my research was to map, understand and curate multiple cohesive approaches to answer the question:

> **how can we address the profound spiritual/psychological, ecological, economic, sociopolitical, technological and educational challenges we're going through and create the more beautiful world our hearts know is possible?**

i.e. how can we address the interconnected [[inner\|inner]] and [[outer\|outer]] dimensions of the [[concepts/design/metacrisis\|metacrisis]]?

as a single young person trying to do research in this very broad direction, the goal of my sharings here isn't to come up with any comprehensive, ultimate thesis. i draw from people who have been asking these questions for their whole lives with the aim of establishing a basic [[responses/lab/knowledge commons\|knowledge commons]] that can better inform us in designing and enabling new, more [[resilient\|resilient]] and [[regenerative\|regenerative]] [[topics/design/systems\|systems]], [[_003_L1F3/core concepts/lifestyles\|lifestyles]] and [[concepts/alchemy/ways of being\|ways of being]].

i believe this process of open [[concepts/alchemy/sensemaking\|sensemaking]], [[topics/design/curation\|curation]] and [[patterns/active patterns/learning/learning out loud\|learning out loud]] will be ever-more important to navigate the very complex, polarized and heavily propagandized [[concepts/design/knowledge ecologies\|information ecologies]] we're embedded in, with [[care\|care]], [[love\|love]] and [[terms/community\|community]], as we navigate both personal and societal [[diagnosis/systemic collapse\|collapse]].

in this spirit, an appropriate sub-title could be: "a curation: how far a 26-year-old could go". it'll present it as both an [[anthology\|anthology]] and a series of original articles, plus accompanying maps, designs, prototypes and illustrations.

#### the structure of the zine

the main questions i'm been asking throughout the zine are:
 
 **1) what is the actual situation we find ourselves in, across many perspectives and dimensions, and what's needed to transform that?**

 first you'll find a curation of resources presenting both wide and deep overviews of the [[human predicament\|human predicament]] and the underlying [[dynamics\|dynamics]] at play.

 **2) what existing response approaches exist? what's their theory of change? what are their level of development and context of applicability?**
 
 i'll present maps, studies and analyses comparing these approaches. 
 
most of the content under these investigations will have the #metacrisis  tag.
 
after getting a lay of the land and navigating through these different perspectives (this might take a while) - as an outcome of this research, we'll dive deep into a couple of my personal key [[_001_MOCs/000 ðŸŸ£ deep game/015 âœ¨ heuristics & inquiries MOC\|inquiries]]:
 
 **3) how can we design [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss.art\|art]], [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss1us.lab\|technology]] and [[concepts/player/game\|games]] support [[concepts/alchemy/consciousness development\|consciousness development]] and ecosystems [[topics/design/regeneration\|regeneration]]?**
 
*a.k.a. how can we develop systems and structures to support life thriving on earth?*
 
here we can look at many initiatives that aren't necessarily metacrisis-aware, but are still contributing significantly to the whole, working towards [[concepts/alchemy/consciousness development\|consciousness development]] and [[topics/design/regeneration\|regeneration]]. relevant pages in this garden will have #alchemy, #design, #lab, #regen  or #player tags.
 
we'll draw inspiration from them for my own [[_001_MOCs/050 ðŸŸ© mid game/080 ðŸ–Œ designs MOC\|designs]], [[_001_MOCs/050 ðŸŸ© mid game/070 ðŸ”© prototypes MOC\|prototypes]], etc - across all these 5 domains. 
 
**4) how can we design life more like a sacred [[concepts/player/game\|game]]?**
 
*a sacred game is an infinite one.* one that's deeply *[[terms/fun\|fun]], [[terms/collaboration\|collaborative]], [[challenging\|challenging]], [[diagnosis/meaning crisis\|meaningful]]* and *[[fulfilling\|fulfilling]]*.
 a game that honors the beauty and mystery of life, that challenges and supports us to [[human flourishing\|flourish]] - to discover ourselves, unfold our potentials and share our gifts with others.
 
this comprises most of the "development" part of my work. the [[_003_L1F3/L1F3 support systems\|L1F3 support systems]], and all their [[_006_core notes/theories of change\|theory of change]] and unfolding [[_001_MOCs/050 ðŸŸ© mid game/080 ðŸ–Œ designs MOC\|designs]], [[_001_MOCs/050 ðŸŸ© mid game/070 ðŸ”© prototypes MOC\|prototypes]], etc. relevant pages in this garden will have the #l1f3 or #metagame tags.
 
there's a lot to be said on it and i won't get into detail now, but just for some people who might have read this and have a resistance with the [[concepts/player/game\|game]] frame (probably due to its often seen competitive, game-theoretical win-lose dynamics), i want to say something - i share that same hesitation.

that's why the concept of game i'm using here is closer to the [[concepts/design/infinite games\|infinite game]] and [[omni-win dynamics\|omni-win dynamics]] observed by thinkers such as [[projects & tools/projects/player/world game\|buckminster fuller in the world game]] and communities such as [[models & frameworks/player/fourgames\|fourgames]], [[initiatives, orgs & communities/design/metagame.wtf\|metagame.wtf]] and [[projects & tools/projects/player/startover.xyz\|startover.xyz]].

**why not use just "play" then?**
 
because games introduce the distinction of [[concepts/player/serious play\|serious play]]. a game can be a container in which you can reduce your scope of action and feel like you truly "gave it your best" at it - it may be an epic journey in which you thrive and learn/gather feedback from that - or you can also fail miserably and learn a bunch of other lessons from that. it provides a context for a profound, immediate, experiential form of learning, since you have a very tight application of the [[models & frameworks/design/OODA loop\|OODA loop]].
 
so my investigation and development in this direction is really an inquiry into how we can:
 
 > transform life into a real-world massive multiplayer online-and-offline collaborative self-transformation & regenerative civilization-building game.
 
(see more at: [[_003_L1F3/l1f3 game\|l1f3 game]])
 
i'll dive a lot more on the motivations, background and philosophical basis of this research on the zine itself.

#### a few of the findings

for people eager to dive into the contents, a few of the foundational findings (at risk of repeating what many [[concepts/design/metacrisis\|metacrisis]] folks bring up) were:

- [[systems transformation\|systemic change]] requires changes in all: [[concepts/design/superstructure\|superstructure]], [[social structure\|social structure]], [[concepts/design/infrastructure\|infrastructure]] and [[physiologic structure\|physiologic structure]] - see: [[models & frameworks/design/holistic cultural materialism\|holistic cultural materialism]].

- [[communism\|communism]] & [[socialism\|socialism]] are not viable large-scale economic alternatives, since they still promote [win-lose games](https://civilizationemerging.com/new-economics-series-3/). even though we could bind [[externalities\|externalities]] at local/global levels, exponential rivalry continues, generating [[diagnosis/systemic collapse\|systemic collapse]] in the long term - see: [[diagnosis/generator functions of existential risk\|generator functions of existential risk]].

- efforts at different levels of intervention are necessary: reducing immediate systemic harm ([[horizon 1\|horizon 1]]), creating conditions for more desirable short/mid-term futures ([[horizon 2\|horizon 2]]), developing new systems altogether ([[horizon 3\|horizon 3]]) - see: [[models & frameworks/design/three horizons\|three horizons]], [[_006_core notes/theories of change\|theories of change]] & [[_006_core notes/design philosophies\|design philosophies]].

there were a plethora of references that informed these perspectives, which i'll dive into in the publication *(see: [[_007_illustrations & sketches/references map.excalidraw\|references map]] - coming soon)*, but the most interesting part (for me) of this research comes after deeply grappling with the context and root causes: when we're mapping/analyzing responses.

one question persisted throughout the research is:

**amidst all of the complexity of ourselves and the world, where should i/we be most focused on?**

[[people/references/alchemy/john vervaeke\|john vervaeke]] points to this process of ongoing [[concepts/alchemy/sensemaking\|sensemaking]] and [[meaning-making\|meaning-making]] as the process of [[recursive relevance realization\|recursive relevance realization]], which starts to give us glimpses of a few answers in his [[diagnosis/meaning crisis\|awakening from the meaning crisis]] lectures.

but there are many other powerful perspectives. my attempt in this is to navigate through them and organize/reflect back in ways that are both practically orienting and challenging of deeper consideration.

a useful synthesis - though still a starting point - which i hope can support especially young people embarking on this journey of deep reflection and transformation, could be:

> although [[responses/lab/mapping\|maps]] can be very useful, there is no recipe. cultivating our own [[concepts/alchemy/wisdom\|wisdom]], nurturing our [[concepts/alchemy/dharma\|dharma]] and endeavoring to unfold our [[unique self\|unique selves]] do seem like worthy pursuits. perhaps with a lot of sincere [[_002_research/research\|research]] and decentralized [[topics/design/coordination systems\|coordination]] we can [[concepts/design/coordination layer\|clarify the nodes in the system where there's the most suffering and work to transform that]], but ultimately, it goes beyond utilitarian optimization towards mitigating suffering. there's something beyond that, often unexplainable, about what each of us feel most called to be/do/become.
> 
> one big challenge though is that often we don't even know what [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1usâ€™ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/archive/databases/experiments master list/disruptive life OS presentation v. 0.1/challenges\|challenges]] and [[possibilities\|possibilities]] exist - both [[_003_L1F3/core concepts/self-transformation\|inside of ourselves]] and [[_003_L1F3/core concepts/life design\|out there in the world]]! the [[civilizational systems\|predominant systems]] in our societies are not designed for us to have this kind of visibility and collaboration. our local efforts can be very impactful and important, but as long our society has globalized [[concepts/design/existential risk\|risks]] and [[potentials\|potentials]], coordinating across the [[superorganism\|superorganism]] to find our place(s) in the whole must become not only a possibility, but a responsibility - hopefully for increasingly more of us.
> 
> it can take several years of trial and error, research and experimentation to find the [[initiatives, orgs & communities/communities MOC\|communities]], [[terms\|terms]], [[perspectives\|perspectives]] that resonate and enrich our [[worldviews\|worldviews]]/[[ways of living\|ways of living]] - and even more time to find ways to make [[concepts/design/sacred economics\|focusing on your part of the puzzle a viable financial possibility]].
> 
> are there ways to make this journey less frustrating, isolating, tiresome and confusing?
> 
> i think so. and my first two steps were: 1) attempting to clarify what exists out there, and 2) attempting to challenge/strengthen my worldviews for coming up with a [[_003_L1F3/L1F3 support systems\|theory of change for my own expression in the world]].

so that's what this book-zine is all about: [[responses/lab/mapping\|mapping]] existing [[philosophical approaches\|approaches]]/[[_006_core notes/theories of change\|theories of change]], consolidating my [[findings\|findings]] based on cold & [[warm data\|warm data]] into a [[responses/lab/knowledge commons\|knowledge commons]] in more [[_000_digital garden/about - my approach to knowledge development\|accessible and nuanced ways]] (which helps with elucidating possible [[developmental pathways\|developmental pathways]]/[[tbprocessed/base notes/concepts - general/learning trails\|learning trails]]), and attempting to [[concepts/alchemy/sensemaking\|make sense]] of the [[concepts/design/complexity\|complexity]] going on - clarifying important [[low-hanging fruits\|low-hanging fruits]], [[leverage points\|leverage points]] & [[leverage points\|critical points of intervention]].

the compilation you will find below is still a *work in development*, but it's already partly available and being constantly updated. in it, i share in a lot more detail everything i've found. but in case you've already resonated, below i describe the status/next steps of this work and how you can contribute to it if you'd like.

#### a note on where i'm going next:

before and throughout all of this research, i've held and developed long-time intuitions about the potential of [[concepts/player/game\|games]]/[[concepts/player/serious play\|serious play]], [[collaborative life playing\|networks]] and [[inquiries & heuristics/what technology is actually worth building\|regenerative technology design]] as powerful & under-developed responses to the [[concepts/design/metacrisis\|metacrisis]].

i'll present several perspectives, references and prototypes that fundament my worldview and would love to further refine them to test/implement through the [[_003_L1F3/L1F3 support systems\|L1F3 support systems]].
