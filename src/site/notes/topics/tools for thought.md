##### intro & my relationship with it

great article on the history of the field and important distinctions: [tools for thought as cultural practices, not computational objects](https://maggieappleton.com/tools-for-thought) or [in video format](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKjxhoavCRM).

###### my highlights from this introduction:

the activities that are currently enabled by TfTs:
![activities enabled by current TfTs - maggie appleton.png](/img/user/activities%20enabled%20by%20current%20TfTs%20-%20maggie%20appleton.png)

![TfT for who - underserved public - maggie appleton.png](/img/user/TfT%20for%20who%20-%20underserved%20public%20-%20maggie%20appleton.png)

so a useful frame for the existing field of TfTs is this:

i'm very interested in this larger scope of "tools for thought", as presented. or as put by [[bret victor\|bret victor]], [[media for thinking the unthinkable\|media for thinking the unthinkable]].

despite that, i still follow closely and experiment with a bunch of the current "computational mediums for white-collar knowledge work" as i find the development of certain capabilities very important for enabling new forms of [[tbprocessed/base notes/concepts - general/sensemaking\|sensemaking]], [[coordination\|coordination]] and [[collaboration\|collaboration]], as part of my research on [[_002_book-zine - viable pathways/personal OS design\|personal OS design]], and as described on my article: [[core essays/ðŸ’­ foundational concepts for developing regenerative information ecologies & empowering knowledge commons\|ðŸ’­ foundational concepts for developing regenerative information ecologies & empowering knowledge commons]].

[[maggie appleton\|maggie appleton]] also uses a different frame that i like, which is "[[tools for open-ended reasoning\|tools for open-ended reasoning]]" for expanding our view on the field. i think it's great because it encompasses more of the [[embodied cognition\|embodied]], [[spatial\|spatial]] and other forms of [[extended cognition\|extended cognition]] that are so relevant for us humans as a whole.

##### resources
