great article on the history of the field and important distinctions: [tools for thought as cultural practices, not computational objects](https://maggieappleton.com/tools-for-thought) or [in video format](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKjxhoavCRM).

###### my highlights from this introduction:

the activities that are currently enabled by TfTs:

so a useful frame for the existing field of TfTs is this:

i'm very interested in this larger scope of "tools for thought", as presented. or as put by [[bret victor\|bret victor]], [[medium for thinking the unthinkable\|medium for thinking the unthinkable]].

despite that, i still follow closely and experiment with a bunch of the current "computational mediums for white-collar knowledge work" as i find the development of certain capabilities very important for enabling new forms of [[tbprocessed/base notes/concepts - general/sensemaking\|sensemaking]], [[coordination\|coordination]] and [[collaboration\|collaboration]], as part of my research on [[_002_book-zine - viable pathways/personal OS design\|personal OS design]], and as described on my article: [[core essays/💭 foundational concepts for developing regenerative information ecologies & empowering knowledge commons\|💭 foundational concepts for developing regenerative information ecologies & empowering knowledge commons]].
