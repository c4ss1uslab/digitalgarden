##### about

the concept/field of knowledge management has been really important for me since i was 15 years old (2014). i've seen the field change and evolve a lot, and i developed a lot of my own [[perspectives\|perspectives]], [[_001_MOCs/050 🟩 mid game/060 🗡 projects MOC\|projects]], [[designs\|designs]] and [[_001_MOCs/050 🟩 mid game/070 🔩 prototypes MOC\|prototypes]] since then.

#### the origin story - my initiation into the fields of self-directed learning & knowledge management

much like [[people/references/lab/alexander obenauer\|alexander obenauer]] with the [[_006_core notes/personal OS design\|future of operating systems]], [[people/references/lab/gordon brander\|gordon brander]] with [[responses/design/protocols for thought\|protocols for thought]], [[people/references/lab/samuel timbó\|samuel timbó]] with [[topics/lab/the future of computing\|the future of computing]], or [[people/references/alchemy/hanzi freinacht\|hanzi freinacht]] with the future of [[topics/architect;design/politics\|politics]], i have a vision for the future of information and knowledge management.

it includes an [[concepts/alchemy/ontology\|ontology]] - the [[_004_L1F3/l1f3 management methodology\|L1F3 management framework]], its application in a [[system\|system]] - the [[_004_L1F3/l1f3 management system\|L1F3 management system]], and its decentralization as part of a [[protocol\|protocol]] - the [[_004_L1F3/l1f3 protocol\|L1F3 protocol]].

head over there to learn about the framework in detail. now, if you wanna know more about where it came from, keep reading.

its origins date back to my first epiphany about life, when i was 15 years old. i was trying to figure out what to do with my life, i discovered a few simple yet profound [[heuristics\|heuristics]] that served as life-changing realizations about myself and life itself, such as - [[inquiries & heuristics/heuristics/life is action\|life is action]], [[inquiries & heuristics/heuristics/life as your most important project\|my life is my biggest project]], [[inquiries & heuristics/heuristics/the best way to predict the future is to create it\|the best way to predict the future is to create it]], i operate in reality through an [[models & frameworks/design/OODA loop\|OODA loop]], [[inquiries & heuristics/heuristics/i can design myself and my life\|i can design myself and my life]] and [[inquiries & heuristics/heuristics/life is a metagame\|life is a metagame]].

this was 2014. i was a teenager interested in the [[future of society\|future of society]], [[education\|education]], [[topics/architect;design/technology\|technology]], [[topics/player/anime\|anime]] and [[games\|games]] that had just been accepted to a technical high school, so i'd graduate with an associate degree in "[[quality management\|quality management]]". i picked this course because it was the broadest of all available.

yet, i only had classes at night and i'd only be able to get an internship at 16. so i had a whole year to dedicate (during daytime) to whatever i wanted to learn.

this could be a good opportunity to figure out what do in college (in brazil we need to know the whole degree upon application). should i go for [[engineering\|engineering]] (in line with my associate degree), [[business management\|business management]] (the broadest one), follow my deep interests (though no clear applicability) of [[psychology\|psychology]]/[[philosophy\|philosophy]]/[[topics/architect;design/economics\|economics]], or really go for [[topics/architect;design/technology\|tech]] ([[topics/lab/computer science\|computer science]])?

i signed up for courses in edx/coursera ([[topics/lab/artificial intelligence\|AI]], [[topics/lab/XR\|XR]], [[topics/player/game design\|game design]]), marginal revolution ([[topics/architect;design/economics\|economics]]), crashcourse ([[psychology\|psychology]]/[[philosophy\|philosophy]]) and [[systems innovation\|systems innovation]] ([[entrepreneurship\|entrepreneurship]], business [[innovation\|innovation]], [[systems thinking\|systems thinking]]).

about 2 weeks in, i had this pervasive feeling that either something was wrong with me or there was something wrong with all of these courses.

based on my experience of learning very quickly and enjoyably though games (very short feedback loops), i had a few intuitions on the subject of [[topics/player/learning\|learning]] itself and an underlying sense of uneasiness, restlessness, that *the way they were teaching was outdated* and *what was being taught* was also ultimately *irrelevant*, or at least, *missing the point*.

it seemed like (and now i know that it didn't only seem, it was the case) that we were being taught to learn skills to "*fit into the marketforce*", to "*serve the demands of other humans*", but not really looking into/figuring out *our own demands*. *our own desires*. *what we want to be learning, doing, making out of our lives*.

it took me a long time to find the words and references to refer to this, both sociologically (work [?], ), but also technically on the subject of learning (more on this below).

the major turning point happened when i went through the whole 4-week "[[learning how to learn\|learning how to learn]]" curriculum in 2 days and was absolutely underwhelmed.

i was seeing clearly how "learning how to learn" isn't about techniques, but mostly about the overall context - environment, frame of mind, references/curation and emotional guidance of the learner. (i.e. [[topics/architect;design/ontological design\|ontological design]]).

plus, lots of intuitions from other references that i eventually found/discovered in KM/its adjacent fields: tools for thought as extended cognition [maggie], transformational tft [andy/michael], the properties of the computational medium [[people/references/lab/bret victor\|bret victor]], knowledge presentation as fractals [], ontologies as [scaling synthesis], topographical intelligence via maps [wardley maps]... and many others that i still haven't found well-articulated by anyone (such as game UI/UXs as incredibly useful for real-life management)...

if i, as a 15-year-old was feeling/noticing all that, how could these experts not be? this, alongside my underwhelming experience at my high school/technical degree, which was an extension of the "second best university in brazil", and therefore supposed to be "good", led me to an [[diagnosis/existential crisis\|existential crisis]].

(given - this specific course was an introductory one. yet, i couldn't stop thinking - was this the most valuable information they could think of sharing to the broadest audience possible? i went into their references and the more i looked into it, the more depressed i felt. their approach to learning was very limited, with no regard whatsoever for [[_004_L1F3/core concepts/life design\|life design]], [[topics/lab/knowledge management\|knowledge management]] and [[topics/player/game design\|game design]].)

i started asking google all of my questions. "what are the fundamental ways in which we learn how we learn?" "why do i have much better tools to manage my fictional characters than tools to manage myself/real life?" "why don't we have missions, challenges, skills, attributes, maps, to manage our lives?" "how do i manage my life as my biggest project?".

i started searching for tools for organizing my learning/self/life.

---

these realizations led me to a few months obsessively researching "how to organize my life", "how to manage a project", "how to manage myself", "tools for playing life more effectively" and trying to stick some spreadsheets together to create a comprehensive "[[l1f3 management system 1\|life management system]]".

"if i don't know what either myself or the world will look like in 5-10 years, instead of committing to just one of these options, couldn't i "learn how to learn" to be prepared/more adaptable for anything that comes my way (or most of it)?"

this awareness of going 'meta' came on: learning how to learn, thinking about how to think, examining how i examine myself (in line with the psychological/philosophical ideas i was starting to get into contact with).

in the MHC framework (part of adult development research), that's exactly the transition into stage 12 - systematic.

finally, i found a few references that helped me orient myself at the time, namely - metacognition, mental models (farnamstreet) and GTD.

even with all this effort, this was 2015 and i lacked the historical background, research skills, network and academic knowledge to help me navigate this inquiry, so even though i started using [[GTD\|GTD]], [[evernote\|evernote]] and lots of coaching tools, it took me 3 years to stumble upon the term "**knowledge management**", and go beyond mainstream ideas, understanding it as both a practice and an actual [academic field of study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_management).

i tried some obscure software such as [[emacs\|emacs]], [[thebrain\|thebrain]], [[bitrix24\|bitrix24]], apps such as [[habitica\|habitica]], [[lifeRPG\|lifeRPG]], [[tbprocessed/base notes/tools;products - general/superbetter\|superbetter]], and my own mix of macros/spreadsheets, zapier/IFTTT, but none of it worked nearly as well as i'd hoped.

to this day, it's extremely dumbfounding to me how we live in an [[information age\|information age]], yet this subject is mostly unknown, relegated as something just for librarians, some IT professionals, a few managers/nerds at a large company, or a handful of questionable consultants and obscure academics.

that is, until ~2018, when tools such as [[tbprocessed/base notes/tools;products - general/notion\|notion]], [[tbprocessed/base notes/ventures - general/roam research\|roam research]] and [[tbprocessed/base notes/ventures - general/obsidian\|obsidian]] were launched, bringing a new surge of popularity to this idea of "[[no-code\|no-code]]", [[topics/architect;design/tools for thought\|tools for thought]] and "[[online productivity tools\|online productivity tools]]" in general - and now it also became a subject for internet nerds. yay! 🙃

since that time i've been dedicating a large amount of my time and energy thinking about "[[personal systems design\|personal systems design]]" in the form of this "[[patterns/active patterns/knowledge management/building a second brain\|building a second brain]]" / "[[digital systems design\|digital systems design]]", but i'd be lying if i said this is the essence of it.

the same feeling that has been with me since my first experience of [[awakening\|awakening]] has changed and evolved in many ways, but still underlies everything i do, learn, sense, share and build in this field. i trust my judgment and experience above all (which is often times challenging, as it proves itself to be "wrong" or simply - true, but partial), but that unique "taste", "design", "feel" still remains as the guiding force, and while i still don't always follow it blindly, there's a unique value to it and i intend to let it unfold.

now, as to what this means in practice:

i believe that by spending a lot of time immersed in this field, but also removing myself completely from it at times and experiencing other walks of life - made me not be pigeonholed and discover several other strongly synergistic fields that don't often dialogue with knowledge management as a discipline/practice.

in fact, these are other areas (mentioned [here]()) that most people on the field don't even know exist (the paradox of a field that's precisely about evidencing knowledge) - and this experience, while incredibly confusing at first, gave me a lot of clarity on how we can move beyond academic propositions and cozy software to agentic psycho-technological tools that can empower and transform the experience of being yourself, even for people that never heard of the term.

and this isn't trashing on the field, i love most of it. i believe most of us researchers/practitioners feel this potential, but i also sense a strong lack of integration of our efforts, a lack on the clarity on the purpose of all this, plus too much hype, speculation, ego and moving in all directions, like in pretty much all other areas of modern civilization.

in short, my understanding/approach today is that:

i don't propose a "definitive" or "best" way to handle information, but i do believe that having clean and relevant data, able to be used in multiple [[interoperable\|interoperable]], [[agent-centric\|agent-centric]] apps and shared in lots of different, flexible, contextual [[prototypes/made by me/l1f3 management system views\|views]], taking into account the different needs and preferences of people/institutions, sure is one of the better ones.

and i've been researching/building several systems, tools and prototypes in this direction - you can see more of them at my [[_001_MOCs/050 🟩 mid game/060 🗡 projects MOC\|projects]] page, or start with the [[_004_L1F3/l1f3 management system\|l1f3 management system]].
