major reference on the subject: [[people/references/architect;design/joseph tainter\|tainter]] on [[the collapse of complex societies\|the collapse of complex societies]].

[[people/references/architect;design/daniel schmachtenberger\|daniel schmachtenberger]] and the folks researching the [[concepts/design/metacrisis\|metacrisis]] also often refer to it as a likely though not desirable outcome from the plethora of [[concepts/design/existential risk\|existential]] and [[terms/catastrophic risk\|catastrophic risks]] we're living through.

the gist of the argument is:

> every major society in the history of our civilization has collapsed. and now we have a globalized one acceleratingly crossing [[planetary boundaries\|planetary boundaries]]. with [[win-lose dynamics\|win-lose dynamics]]/[[concepts/design/moloch\|molochian]] forces at work, it seems like we're in a very challenging trajectory that needs drastic change.

[[nate hagens\|nate hagens]] on [[concepts/design/the great simplification\|the great simplification]] puts it brilliantly on an [[energy consumption\|energy consumption]] framing.

the book [[references/alchemy/first principles and first values\|first principles and first values]] also discusses it to a great degree, in the context of the [[concepts/design/metacrisis\|metacrisis]].

great explorations on the subject from an [[concepts/design/infrastructure\|infrastructure]]/[[hardware\|hardware]] perspective: [XXIIVV — collapse](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/collapse.html),  [Collapse OS — Why?](http://collapseos.org/), [Collapse OS — what makes collapse inevitable and imminent](http://collapseos.org/civ.html).

the more i read into it, the more likely this seems. but even with my caveats/holding back from [[doomerism\|doomerism]] it seems to me that:

**ultimately, collapsing or not really doesn't matter much**.

even if our analysis is wrong once again and we don't collapse (which doesn't seem likely), it's about how our current [[topics/architect;design/lifestyles\|lifestyles]] have become insanely wasteful, alienating, disconnected from nature and ourselves. depressing, really.

it's not about being right about what's going to happen, or some speculative mental masturbation exercise. to put it simply, the [[right relationship\|right relationship]] to be in with life/nature isn't one of extraction and mindless consumption, but of respect and constant learning about the delicate web of impacts from our actions.

this conscious relationship with reality is what i want to work towards.
