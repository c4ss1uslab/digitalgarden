##### intro & my relationship with it

this is a major field of study/research for me, especially if we expand our understanding of conventional "thought" into [[concepts/extended cognition\|extended cognition]] as a whole.

[[people/maggie appleton\|maggie appleton]] already does that simply yet brilliantly in this article presenting on the history of the field and a few important distinctions - [[tools for thought as cultural practices, not computational objects\|tools for thought as cultural practices, not computational objects]].

so a useful frame for the existing field of TfTs is this:

i'm very interested in this larger scope of "tools for thought", as presented. or as put by [[people/bret victor\|bret victor]], [[media for thinking the unthinkable\|media for thinking the unthinkable]]. especially as i have experienced very profoundly the depth/potential of other types of intelligence within myself - [[somatic intelligence\|somatic intelligence]] (& [[concepts/embodied cognition\|embodied cognition]] through [[ayahuasca\|ayahuasca]] ceremonies), [[musical intelligence\|musical intelligence]] (via [[initiatives, orgs & communities/música do círculo\|música do círculo]]) and [[spatial intelligence\|spatial]]/[[topographical intelligence\|topographical intelligence]] (via [[topics/player/gaming\|gaming]] and [[models & frameworks/wardley mapping\|wardley mapping]]).

despite that, i still follow closely and experiment with a bunch of the current "computational mediums for white-collar knowledge work" as i find the development of certain capabilities (see: [[projects & tools/xanadu\|xanadu]], [[projects & tools/softspace\|softspace]], [[projects & tools/wonderOS\|wonderOS]], [[tbprocessed/base notes/ventures - general/holochain\|holochain]] for examples) very important for enabling new forms of [[tbprocessed/base notes/concepts - general/sensemaking\|sensemaking]], [[concepts/coordination\|coordination]] and [[terms/collaboration\|collaboration]], as part of my research on [[_005_core notes/personal OS design\|personal OS design]], and as described on my article: [[core essays/💭 foundational concepts for developing regenerative information ecologies & empowering knowledge commons\|💭 foundational concepts for developing regenerative information ecologies & empowering knowledge commons]].

[[people/maggie appleton\|maggie appleton]] also uses a different frame that i like, which is "[[terms/tools for open-ended reasoning\|tools for open-ended reasoning]]" for expanding our view on the field. i think it's great because it encompasses more of the [[concepts/embodied cognition\|embodied]], [[spatial intelligence\|spatial]] and other forms of [[concepts/extended cognition\|extended cognition]] that are so relevant for us humans as a whole.
