see: [[topics/lab/algorithms\|algorithms]]

algorithms can specify the logic/[[terms/decision-making\|decision-making]] processes you use to navigate yourself and the world.

existing, centralized algorithms are based on what they measure/think that i am (now) vs (make it harder) to become who i want to be

what's my minimum self-recommended algorithm?

[[social curation\|social curation]] is a powerful force that underlined our developmental processes as a species throughout time. it's a good place to start. what do you like/resonate with? what do *they* like/resonate with?
