one of my main objectives through the [[_003_L1F3/L1F3.stream\|L1F3]] projects is to support the development of a [[concepts/design/coordination layer\|coordination layer]] both for humans and the more-than-human world. many people in the [[concepts/design/metacrisis\|metacrisis]] and [[topics/design/web3\|web3]] communities are also attempting to do that in global/large scales, in different ways. many [[social change\|social]] and [[topics/regen/earth regeneration\|regenerative movements]] are also attempting to do it in mostly local/regional scales.

this subject has taken me and still will take a lot of study/research/experimentation over decades to come, but there are important concepts, initiatives and possibilities to be further developed in the present.

see: [[initiatives, orgs & communities/design/SEEDS (ecosystem)\|SEEDS]] for a breakdown and exploration of each one.
