**alternative:** a good intro in video format - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MZ7X6cBPnM

my highlights from this video:

16:11 "we have the metacrisis. the metacrisis is driven by existential risk. existential risk is driven by exponentialized technologies being weaponized. that itself is driven by win-lose metrics/rivalrous conflict, that generates the races to the bottom, the tragedies of the commons, multipolar traps - everyone has to develop that weapon system, but there's no interior technology to respond to it" (...) "at the core of the metacrisis is what? a breakdown in a shared story of value (that could actually generate a response to the metacrisis)." for the first time, we do'
we can't cohere/resonate unless we have the same story of value. it's the story of value that generates the possibility of coherence.

"pre-tragic / tragic / post-tragic consciousness"

"the interior of interconnectivity (systems complexity) is intimacy"

"mytho-poetic moves vs ontological moves"
