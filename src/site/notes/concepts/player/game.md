##### a few of my favorite definitions of "game"

[[models & frameworks/player/ERGO\|ERGO]] model: [[terms/environment\|environment]], [[roles\|roles]], [[guidelines\|guidelines]], [[objectives\|objectives]]. (source: [[antonio (lala)\|antonio (lala)]])

"A game is a form of play with goals and structure." (Kevin J. Maroney)

"A game is a form of art in which participants, termed¬†_players_, make decisions in order to manage resources through game tokens in the pursuit of a goal." ([Greg Costikyan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Costikyan "Greg Costikyan"))

"A game is an¬†_activity_¬†among two or more independent¬†_decision-makers_¬†seeking to achieve their¬†_objectives_¬†in some¬†_limiting context._" ([Clark C. Abt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_C._Abt "Clark C. Abt"))

"All games share four defining traits: a goal, rules, a feedback system, and voluntary participation." ([Jane McGonigal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_McGonigal "Jane McGonigal"))

#### types of games

###### 4-quadrant view:

1) self-discovery/transformation ([[concepts/alchemy/waking up\|waking up]])
2) learning/capacity development ([[concepts/alchemy/growing up\|growing up]])
3) self-healing/relationship building ([[concepts/alchemy/cleaning up\|cleaning up]])
4) strategy/co-creation ([[concepts/alchemy/showing up\|showing up]])

###### coordination/peace games

instead of (or in addition to) war/combat games, can we have coordination/peace games?

the "[[projects & tools/projects/player/world game\|great logistics game]]" or "[[projects & tools/projects/player/world game\|world (peace) game]]" was proposed by [[initiatives, orgs & communities/architect;design/buckminster fuller institute\|buckminster fuller institute]] as a tool to facilitate a comprehensive, anticipatory, design science approach to the problems of the world.

its goal is to figure out how to: 


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/projects-and-tools/projects/player/world-game/#52ca2c" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">



> "make the world work, for 100% of humanity, in the shortest possible time, through spontaneous cooperation, without ecological offense or the disadvantage of anyone." 

</div></div>


other approaches:
1) 70s - [[cybersyn\|cybersyn]] - distributed decision support system to aid in the management of the national economy - birth of cybernetics.

a FOSS, user-owned system with a plug-and-play marketplace of games, frameworks, agents and communities.
