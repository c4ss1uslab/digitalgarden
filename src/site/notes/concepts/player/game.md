when i'm talking about games, i'm most interested in the context of a "[[responses/player/serious games\|serious game]]". i.e. one that has a practical impact on our lives/ways of seeing the world.

or [[metagames\|metagames]] - i.e. games that create other games. i'll explore a bit more on both here.

##### a few of my favorite definitions of "game"

[[models & frameworks/player/ERGO\|ERGO]] model: [[terms/environment\|environment]], [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1us’ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/concepts & frameworks/roles/roles\|roles]], [[guidelines\|guidelines]], [[objectives\|objectives]]. (source: [[antonio (lala)\|antonio (lala)]])

"A game is a form of play with goals and structure." (Kevin J. Maroney)

"A game is a form of art in which participants, termed _players_, make decisions in order to manage resources through game tokens in the pursuit of a goal." ([Greg Costikyan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Costikyan "Greg Costikyan"))

"A game is an _activity_ among two or more independent _decision-makers_ seeking to achieve their _objectives_ in some _limiting context._" ([Clark C. Abt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_C._Abt "Clark C. Abt"))

"All games share four defining traits: a goal, rules, a feedback system, and voluntary participation." ([Jane McGonigal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_McGonigal "Jane McGonigal"))

#### coordination/peace games

instead of (or in addition to) war/combat games, can we have coordination/peace games?

the "[[projects & tools/projects/player/world game\|great logistics game]]" or "[[projects & tools/projects/player/world game\|world (peace) game]]" was proposed by [[initiatives, orgs & communities/design/buckminster fuller institute\|buckminster fuller institute]] as a tool to facilitate a comprehensive, anticipatory, design science approach to the problems of the world.

its goal is to figure out how to:
