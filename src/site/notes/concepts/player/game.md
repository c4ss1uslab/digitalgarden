##### a few of my favorite definitions of "game"

[[models & frameworks/player/ERGO\|ERGO]] model: [[terms/environment\|environment]], [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1us‚Äô notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/concepts & frameworks/roles/roles\|roles]], [[guidelines\|guidelines]], [[objectives\|objectives]]. (source: [[antonio (lala)\|antonio (lala)]])

"A game is a form of play with goals and structure." (Kevin J. Maroney)

"A game is a form of art in which participants, termed¬†_players_, make decisions in order to manage resources through game tokens in the pursuit of a goal." ([Greg Costikyan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Costikyan "Greg Costikyan"))

"A game is an¬†_activity_¬†among two or more independent¬†_decision-makers_¬†seeking to achieve their¬†_objectives_¬†in some¬†_limiting context._" ([Clark C. Abt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_C._Abt "Clark C. Abt"))

"All games share four defining traits: a goal, rules, a feedback system, and voluntary participation." ([Jane McGonigal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_McGonigal "Jane McGonigal"))

#### types of metagames

###### 4-quadrant view:

1) self-discovery/transformation games ([[concepts/alchemy/waking up\|waking up]])
2) learning/capacity development games ([[concepts/alchemy/growing up\|growing up]])
3) self-healing/relationship building games ([[concepts/alchemy/cleaning up\|cleaning up]])
4) strategy/co-creation games ([[concepts/alchemy/showing up\|showing up]])

###### coordination/peace games

instead of (or in addition to) war/combat games, can we have coordination/peace games?

the "[[projects & tools/projects/player/world game\|great logistics game]]" or "[[projects & tools/projects/player/world game\|world (peace) game]]" was proposed by [[initiatives, orgs & communities/design/buckminster fuller institute\|buckminster fuller institute]] as a tool to facilitate a comprehensive, anticipatory, design science approach to the problems of the world.

its goal is to figure out how to:

> "make the world work, for 100% of humanity, in the shortest possible time, through spontaneous cooperation, without ecological offense or the disadvantage of anyone."

other approaches:
- 70s - [[projects & tools/projects/design/cybersyn\|cybersyn]] - distributed decision support system to aid in the management of the national economy - during the birth of cybernetics.

‚≠ê major distinction: [[regenerative games\|regenerative games]] vs [[self-termination games\|self-termination games]] / [[concepts/design/infinite games\|infinite]] vs [[finite games\|finite games]]

a FOSS, user-owned system with a plug-and-play marketplace of games, frameworks, agents and communities.
