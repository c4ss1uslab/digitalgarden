very interesting framing proposed by [[initiatives, orgs & communities/life itself\|life itself]] on the civilization era we're living.

https://secondrenaissance.net/

lots of good resources there, especially for introducing people into this mode of thinking about our current age - its beauties, failures, challenges & potentials.

##### why is this relevant and why now?

**intro** - https://secondrenaissance.net/intro

**whitepaper** - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m6gA7GKansoJdRZEr1zO6Ds7Hp5rMvo6/view
it's like a summary of [[people/hanzi freinacht\|hanzi]]'s [[listening society\|listening society]]. great intro.

everything on the wiki - https://wiki.secondrenaissance.net/wiki/The_Second_Renaissance_wiki

\+ there's [a research group](https://lifeitself.org/research) doing continued work on this project of the 2R and some of its sub-fields (such as [[deliberately developmental spaces\|deliberately developmental spaces]], [[ecosystem mapping\|ecosystem mapping]], and more).

##### my reflections

the question that arises for me is: is a "second renaissance" possible (in our current day and age) without some "dark age" period? or will we inevitably move towards collapse?

how can we facilitate a graceful descent? and could that descent still really be a "renaissance"?

maybe yes. a material descent/complete makeover and a spiritual/regenerative renaissance?

it deeply resonates. a renaissance full of meaning, flourishing, revival, regeneration. widespread more conscious, challenging, yet nourishing lifestyles and ways of being. [[metamodern arts\|metamodern arts]], [[indigenous wisdom\|indigenous wisdom]], [[topics/architect;design/systems science\|systems]] and [[concepts/interior sciences\|interior sciences]] show viable ways forward. [[initiatives, orgs & communities/life itself\|life itself]] and my own efforts in mapping emergent initiatives/ecosystems also do.

hopefully we're able to mature quickly and powerfully enough to facilitate this transition gracefully.

*why i'm a bit worried:*

if we look at the actual hard data, underlying systems of our civilizations, the major drivers of the [[concepts/metacrisis\|metacrisis]] are the basis of our modern society - and its underlying dynamics of [[exponentialization of existential and catastrophic risks\|exponentialization of existential and catastrophic risks]] and [[topics/architect;design/systems\|systems]]/[[behaviors\|behaviors]] that are increasingly exploitative, wealth-concentrating and [[debasing our ecological substrate\|debasing our ecological substrate]].

without any major civilizational-level changes, the trajectory we're headed towards is a collapse (and of the ugly kind), or more hopefully, as [[nate hagens\|nate hagens]] states, a [[concepts/the great simplification\|great simplification]].

still, we as a humanity have made major civilization shifts before. my hope/work towards is that we can consciously navigate it this time.

##### other perspectives:

although it's inspiring to me, to many, especially in the global south, it may feel/seem like an [[eurocentric\|eurocentric]] term. so i'd like to also use other terms such as the [[tbprocessed/base notes/concepts - general/regenerative renaissance\|regenerative renaissance]] and [[tbprocessed/base notes/concepts - general/metamodern renaissance\|metamodern renaissance]]. but the framing of the "second renaissance" really puts into perspective our present-day in historical time and can help us more deeply question the nature/essence of a renaissance, really, so i like that.


*other thoughts:*

the first renaissance was an age of retrieval of lost [[knowledge\|knowledge]] & [[wisdom\|wisdom]], a profound questioning that permeated the zeitgeist and produced new expressions of the [[true\|true]], [[good\|good]] and [[beautiful\|beautiful]] (e.g. science, law and art) integrating some ancient wisdom with the tools, discoveries and context of modernity.

the second renaissance is a retrieval not only of lost ([[indigenous knowledge\|indigenous knowledge]]/[[indigenous wisdom\|wisdom]]), but also of lost [[concepts/ways of knowing\|ways of knowing]].
