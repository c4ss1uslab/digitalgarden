AQAL is short for: all [[models & frameworks/four quadrants\|quadrants]], all [[levels\|levels]], all [[lines\|lines]], all [[states\|states]], all [[types\|types]].

it's one of the core frameworks proposed by [[people/ken wilber\|ken wilber]], it integrates multiple other frameworks into a single one that encapsulates most of [[concepts/integral theory\|integral theory]].

it's one of the frames that helped me the most and reoriented my whole perception on life, so i highly recommend getting to know it. lots of people in the [[tbprocessed/base notes/concepts - general/game b\|game b]] / [[concepts/metacrisis\|metacrisis]] space also use it as a way to support complex, multi-perspectival, holistic [[tbprocessed/base notes/concepts - general/sensemaking\|sensemaking]]. 
the shortest introduction to the subject i know/like is [[initiatives, orgs & communities/integral life\|integral life]]'s ["what is the integral approach?"](https://integrallife.com/what-is-integral-approach/).

for further recommendations, i suggest starting with the book [[areas/life areas (base)/alchemy/a brief history of everything\|a brief history of everything]]. if reading isn't your preferred medium at the moment, there's this [youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgMC56yzL6LwzEAjsdlj9BGzFCm1_3URZ), which i haven't seen fully but that seems good.
