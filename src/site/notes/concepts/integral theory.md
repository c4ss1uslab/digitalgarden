it's one of the frames that helped me the most and reoriented my whole perception on life, so i highly recommend getting to know it. lots of people in the [[tbprocessed/base notes/concepts - general/game b\|game b]] / [[concepts/metacrisis\|metacrisis]] space also use it as a way to support complex, multi-perspectival [[tbprocessed/base notes/concepts - general/sensemaking\|sensemaking]].

the shortest introduction to the subject i know/like is [[integral life\|integral life]]'s ["what is the integral approach?"](https://integrallife.com/what-is-integral-approach/).

for further recommendations, i suggest starting with the book [[a brief history of everything\|a brief history of everything]]. if reading isn't your preferred medium at the moment, there's this [youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgMC56yzL6LwzEAjsdlj9BGzFCm1_3URZ), which i haven't seen fully but that seems good.
