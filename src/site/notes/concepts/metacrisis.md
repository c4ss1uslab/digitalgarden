the metacrisis is a lens for analyzing/understanding the *human predicament* and the complexity of our current moment in the history of civilizations.

*definition i use:* the metacrisis is the set of interconnected, interdependent crises of our time, that seem to be leading us towards any or a mixture of these: a) impending systemic collapse as we approach planetary boundaries, b) authoritarian modes of damage control or c) transition into more regenerative, mature, antifragile civilizations and lifestyles.

###### main references

i strongly recommend checking out [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj8H7uBaUwDvd18QrEPugPMD5Z6Y0W-vB) that i curated (30h of content).

https://www.sloww.co/meta-crisis-101/ - the deepest / most multi-perspectival introduction to it, though quite dense, especially for first timers. i recommend checking out some of [[people/references/daniel schmachtenberger\|daniel schmachtenberger]]'s videos on the playlist above before, as a more palatable introduction.

https://metacrisis.org/ - a meta-resource - links to lots of other great content and resources.

https://wiki.metacrisis.xyz/ - a great and extensive index of perspectives for diagnosis, response patterns and projects addressing multiple parts of it.

https://metacrisis.xyz/ - a few particularly influential folks trying to curate, articulate and coordinate around the metacrisis.

https://www.gameb.wiki/ - a wiki with not a lot, but very relevant content, great for rabbit hole investigations/deep dives.

###### an incomplete yet useful way to break down the metacrisis

i found it useful to highlight 5 "core", interdependent crises underpinning the metacrisis:

the [[areas/spiritual\|spiritual]]/[[psychological\|psychological]], [[economic\|economic]], [[ecological\|ecological]], [[political\|political]], and [[educational\|educational]] crises.

which can then be broken down into several others:

-> spiritual/psychological -> [[concepts/meaning crisis\|meaning]], [[existential crisis\|existential crisis]], [[intimacy crisis\|intimacy crisis]], etc...
-> economic -> [[financial crisis\|financial crisis]], [[technological risk\|technological risk]], [[concepts/capability crisis\|capability crisis]], etc...
-> ecological -> [[concepts/health crisis\|health]], [[topics/architect;design/climate crisis\|climate crisis]], [[topics/architect;design/energy crisis\|energy crisis]], etc...
-> political -> [[concepts/legitimacy crisis\|legitimacy crisis]], [[concepts/coordination failure\|coordination failure]], [[geopolitical risks\|geopolitical risks]], etc...
-> educational -> [[concepts/sensemaking crisis\|sensemaking]], [[wisdom crisis\|wisdom crisis]], [[institutional crisis\|institutional crisis]], etc...

they loosely map into the [[models & frameworks/four quadrants\|four quadrants]]/[[models & frameworks/framework variations/5 elements\|5 elements]] framework, which helps to navigate/coordinate around it. they are crises of different dimensions ([[inner\|inner]], [[outer\|outer]], [[individual\|individual]], [[collective\|collective]]).
