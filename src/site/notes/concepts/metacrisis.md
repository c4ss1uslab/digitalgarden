###### main resources

https://www.sloww.co/meta-crisis-101/ - the deepest / most multi-perspectival introduction to it, though quite dense, especially for first timers. i recommend one of [[daniel schmachtenberger\|daniel schmachtenberger]]'s videos as a more palatable introduction (see below under "my favorite references").

https://metacrisis.org/ - a meta-resource - links to lots of other great content and resources.

https://wiki.metacrisis.xyz/ - a great and extensive index of perspectives for diagnosis, response patterns and projects addressing multiple parts of it.

https://metacrisis.xyz/ - a few particularly influential folks trying to curate, articulate and coordinate around the metacrisis.

https://www.gameb.wiki/ - a wiki with not a lot, but very relevant content, great for rabbit hole investigations/deep dives.

a loose/incomplete yet useful way i found to break down the metacrisis is by highlighting 5 "core", interdependent crises:

the [[spiritual\|spiritual]]/[[psychological\|psychological]], [[ecological\|ecological]], [[political\|political]], [[economic\|economic]] and [[educational\|educational]] crises.

which can then be broken down into several others:

-> spiritual/psychological -> [[meaning crisis\|meaning]], [[existential crisis\|existential crisis]], etc...
-> ecological -> [[health crisis\|health]], [[climate crisis\|climate crisis]], [[intimacy crisis\|intimacy crisis]], etc...
-> economic -> [[capability crisis\|capability crisis]], [[technological risk\|technological risk]], etc...
-> political -> [[commons crisis\|commons]], [[legitimacy crisis\|legitimacy crisis]] etc...
-> educational -> [[sensemaking crisis\|sensemaking]], [[wisdom crisis\|wisdom crisis]], etc...
