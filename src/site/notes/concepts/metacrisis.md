the metacrisis is a lens on our critical current moment in the history of civilization and the *human predicament*.

*my definition:* the metacrisis is the set of interconnected, interdependent crises of our time, leading us either towards a) impending systemic collapse as we approach planetary boundaries, b) authoritarian modes of damage control or c) transition into more regenerative, mature, antifragile civilizations and lifestyles.

i strongly recommend checking out [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj8H7uBaUwDvd18QrEPugPMD5Z6Y0W-vB) that i curated (30h of content).

https://www.sloww.co/meta-crisis-101/ - the deepest / most multi-perspectival introduction to it, though quite dense, especially for first timers. i recommend checking out some of [[people/references/daniel schmachtenberger\|daniel schmachtenberger]]'s videos above before, as a more palatable introduction.

https://metacrisis.org/ - a meta-resource - links to lots of other great content and resources.

https://wiki.metacrisis.xyz/ - a great and extensive index of perspectives for diagnosis, response patterns and projects addressing multiple parts of it.

https://metacrisis.xyz/ - a few particularly influential folks trying to curate, articulate and coordinate around the metacrisis.

https://www.gameb.wiki/ - a wiki with not a lot, but very relevant content, great for rabbit hole investigations/deep dives.

###### an incomplete yet useful way to break down the metacrisis

i found it useful to highlight 5 "core", interdependent crises:

the [[areas/spiritual\|spiritual]]/[[psychological\|psychological]], [[economic\|economic]], [[ecological\|ecological]], [[political\|political]], and [[educational\|educational]] crises.

which can then be broken down into several others:

-> spiritual/psychological -> [[concepts/meaning crisis\|meaning]], [[existential crisis\|existential crisis]], etc...
-> economic -> [[concepts/capability crisis\|capability crisis]], [[technological risk\|technological risk]], etc...
-> ecological -> [[concepts/health crisis\|health]], [[climate crisis\|climate crisis]], [[intimacy crisis\|intimacy crisis]], etc...
-> political -> [[concepts/legitimacy crisis\|legitimacy crisis]], [[concepts/coordination failure\|coordination failure]], etc...
-> educational -> [[concepts/sensemaking crisis\|sensemaking]], [[wisdom crisis\|wisdom crisis]], etc...

they loosely map into the [[models & frameworks/four quadrants\|four quadrants]]/[[models & frameworks/framework variations/5 elements\|models & frameworks/framework variations/5 elements]] framework, which helps to memorize/communicate about it. they are crises of different dimensions ([[inner\|inner]], [[outer\|outer]], [[individual\|individual]], [[collective\|collective]]).
