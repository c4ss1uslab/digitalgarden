## 1) definitions & types of maps


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/models-and-frameworks/wardley-mapping/#according-to-wardley-mapping-any-map-contains-the-following-6-elements" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">



###### according to wardley mapping, any map contains the following 6 elements:

- visual representation
- context specific
- **position** of **components** relative to some form of **anchor**
- movement of those components


</div></div>


which is a very specific frame, and makes us realize how, according to this perspective, most of the digital maps we use/interact with aren't maps at all. they're usually [[models\|models]], [[frameworks\|frameworks]], [[sketches\|sketches]] or [[illustrations\|illustrations]].

yet, many people refer to them as maps, so i'll propose a different, more loose classification of maps taking into account other people's curation of popular maps as well:
### types of maps:

#### 1) [[models & frameworks/wardley mapping\|wardley maps]]

![example wardley map - annotated.png|500](/img/user/images/maps/example%20wardley%20map%20-%20annotated.png)

#### 2) [[tang jeff\|tang jeff]]'s classification on twitter:

[![tang jeff's map classification.png](/img/user/images/maps/tang%20jeff's%20map%20classification.png)](https://twitter.com/tangjeff0/status/1274871473392496641)

i highly encourage you to check out the whole thread, as pasting everything here would be flooding this page.

-> as a summary, he suggests:

a) [[memespace maps\|memespace maps]]
b) [[ribbonfarm\|ribbonfarm]]'s maps
c) [[defining characteristics of maps\|defining characteristics of maps]]
d) [[maps of maps\|maps of maps]] (curating/organizing perspectives)
e) [[models & frameworks/wardley mapping\|wardley maps]]
f) [[idea mazes\|idea mazes]]
g) [[subway maps\|subway maps]] (visual)
h) [[topical maps\|topical maps]]/[[field maps\|field maps]] ([[zoomable maps\|zoomable maps]]/maps with meaningful axes and proportions)

i think it can be enlightening to evidence the focus on topics vs the format.

memespace/subway maps/maps of maps are maps that refer to a specific topic.

ribbonfarm/wardley maps are "types" of map based on their style/format, which is derived from a specific creator.

idea mazes / field maps are also on the format side, but regardless of their creator.

#### 3) [[nadia asparouhova\|nadia asparouhova]]'s classification at [[tbprocessed/base notes/ventures - general/the stoa\|the stoa]]:

source: https://nadia.xyz/mapping-digital-worlds / https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvAyJImbEeA

i honestly don't recommend going through the whole thing, unless you have time to spare, as i believe the summary below captures the essence pretty well.

-> nadia's classification summary:

a) [[skeumorphic maps\|skeumorphic maps]]
![1 - skeumorphic maps.png|500](/img/user/images/maps/1%20-%20skeumorphic%20maps.png)

b) [[schematic maps\|schematic maps]]
![2 - schematic maps.png|500](/img/user/images/maps/2%20-%20schematic%20maps.png)

c) [[matrix maps\|matrix maps]]
![3 - matrix maps.png|500](/img/user/images/maps/3%20-%20matrix%20maps.png)

d) [[chinese menu maps\|chinese menu maps]]
![4 - chinese menu maps.png|500](/img/user/images/maps/4%20-%20chinese%20menu%20maps.png)

e) [[word cloud maps\|word cloud maps]]
![5 - word cloud maps.png|500](/img/user/images/maps/5%20-%20word%20cloud%20maps.png)

f) [[type of guy maps\|type of guy maps]]
![6 - type of guy maps.png|500](/img/user/images/maps/6%20-%20type%20of%20guy%20maps.png)

#### 4) lastly, other types of common maps:

a) [[ecosystem maps\|ecosystem maps]]:

![liminal web map.png|500](/img/user/images/maps/liminal%20web%20map.png)

b) [[concept maps\|concept maps]] (a.k.a. [[topics/alchemy/mental models\|mental models]]/[[frameworks\|frameworks]]):
--> proposes a model that describes how something works or can work.

![social layers.png|500](/img/user/images/models%20&%20frameworks/social%20layers.png)

c) [[general knowledge maps\|general knowledge maps]] / [[relationship maps\|relationship maps]]:

![xiq - knowledge map.png|500](/img/user/images/maps/xiq%20-%20knowledge%20map.png)

- [[tom critchlow\|tom critchlow]]'s curation of resources: https://tomcritchlow.com/wiki/maps/
