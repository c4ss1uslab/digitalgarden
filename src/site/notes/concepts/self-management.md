people that are engaged in self-management are usually taking one of 2 routes:

1) [[self-tracking\|self-tracking]] / [[topics/lab/quantified self\|quantified self]] (a more data-driven approach), concerned with such as [[biohacking\|biohacking]]/[[concepts/neurohacking\|neurohacking]], [[health metrics\|health metrics]]/[[performance metrics\|performance metrics]] and more [[behavioral psychology\|behavioral psychology]] tools such as [[CBT\|CBT]], [[mindfulness\|mindfulness]] research. (+ there's a growing body of research on [[compassion\|compassion]], [[models & frameworks/inner development goals\|inner development goals]] and initiatives such as [[29k\|29k]], [[tbprocessed/base notes/tools;products - general/superbetter\|superbetter]], etc)...

2) managing one's [[emotional states\|emotional states]] or [[inner parts\|inner parts]] (a more psycho-spiritual/therapeutic approach), using tools such as [[models & frameworks/internal family systems\|internal family systems]], [[parts work\|parts work]], [[inner engineering\|inner engineering]], [[shadow work\|shadow work]], [[trauma\|trauma]], [[concepts/energy work\|energy work]], and other [[concepts/psychotechnologies\|psychotechnologies]].

my proposal is to recognize the complementarity of them and do both. :)

[[models & frameworks/integral theory\|integral theory]] shows that distinction/complementarity through the framework of the [[models & frameworks/four quadrants\|four quadrants]] (applied/shown below), which says that each of these is focusing on a different dimension of reality. (individual exterior vs individual interior) - and so [[models & frameworks/integral theory\|integral]] provides a great foundation to build upon and do both inner/outer tracking + presents fantastic distinctions on [[self-development\|self-development]], namely the [[models & frameworks/AQAL\|AQAL]] framework - [[models & frameworks/four quadrants\|quadrants]], [[states\|states]], [[stages\|stages]], [[types\|types]], [[lines\|lines]].

[[people/references/alchemy/hanzi freinacht\|hanzi freinacht]] also has great distinctions which can be powerfully applied, conceptualizing [[human development\|human development]] as a sum of [[cognitive development\|cognitive development]], [[cultural code\|cultural code]], [[overall state\|overall state]] and [[existential depth\|existential depth]].

a good introduction to this broader perspective of self-management:
