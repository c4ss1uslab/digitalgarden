people that are engaged in self-management are usually taking one of 2 routes:

1) [[self-tracking\|self-tracking]] / [[topics/lab/quantified self\|quantified self]] (a more data-driven approach), concerned with such as [[biohacking\|biohacking]]/[[concepts/neurohacking\|neurohacking]], [[health metrics\|health metrics]]/[[performance metrics\|performance metrics]] and more [[behavioral psychology\|behavioral psychology]] tools such as [[CBT\|CBT]], [[mindfulness\|mindfulness]] research. (+ there's a growing body of research on [[compassion\|compassion]], [[models & frameworks/inner development goals\|inner development goals]], etc and initiatives such as [[29k\|29k]], etc)...

2) managing one's [[emotional states\|emotional states]] or [[inner parts\|inner parts]] (a more psycho-spiritual approach), using tools such as [[models & frameworks/internal family systems\|internal family systems]], [[parts work\|parts work]], [[inner engineering\|inner engineering]], [[shadow work\|shadow work]], [[trauma\|trauma]], [[concepts/energy work\|energy work]], and other [[concepts/psychotechnologies\|psychotechnologies]]..

my proposal is to recognize the complementarity of them and do both. :)

[[concepts/integral theory\|integral theory]] provides a great foundation to understand and do that (inner/outer tracking + distinctions around [[states\|states]], [[stages\|stages]], [[types\|types]], [[lines\|lines]] and [[models & frameworks/four quadrants\|quadrants]]).

a good intro:
