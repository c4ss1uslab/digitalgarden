a [[theory\|theory]] proposed by [[nate hagens\|nate hagens]] and the [[institute for energy and our future\|institute for energy and our future]]. it states that we're heading towards a great simplification of our lifestyles and societies in the near (50-100-year) future, driven primarily by our unconscious use of the [[energy\|energy]] and [[materials\|materials]] of our planet and construction of extremely fragile and complicated supply chains/civilizational systems (and therefore we're quickly heading towards shortage/depletion and exponentially-increasing risks of collapse).

it's also the name of the podcast [[nate hagens\|nate hagens]] hosts around the topic.

an amazing introduction to the subject: [A Systems Approach Towards a (More) Sustainable Future: An Invitation to Academia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bE7Bbnvf4ko).

##### context

the video above is one the #top3 videos i've watched in 2024. it really opened my eyes to the material/energetic layer that permeates all aspects of our lives, and how the "green"/[[energy transition\|energy transition]] isn't happening at all and isn't hinting that it will anytime soon. we have a major "[[energy blindness\|energy blindness]]" as a society. there are certain almost dogmatic [[climate tribes\|climate tribes]] defending their viewpoint as the only valid one, and if we want to survive and thrive while stewarding a 8-billion person civilization, it seems that we need a wide range of new approaches to enable a major [[phase shift\|phase shift]] in how we see and handle our [[energy\|energy]] use.

it goes beyond the common [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1usâ€™ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/concepts & frameworks/concepts & frameworks/climate change\|climate change]] narrative that's often about [[CO2 emission\|CO2 emission]], [[biodiversity loss\|biodiversity loss]], [[coral preservation\|coral preservation]], etc, and present an outlook looking at the many different interconnected variables. in a sense, it's similar to the [[degrowth\|degrowth]] narrative, yet way less climate-centric, and more considering of the whole set of systemic effects ([[mass migration\|mass migration]], [[AI risk\|AI risk]], [[cultural breakdown\|cultural breakdown]], etc).

(eye-opening content that's making me reconsider the [[ethics\|ethics]] of all of our [[topics/lab/technology development\|technology development]] and [[_003_L1F3/core concepts/lifestyles\|lifestyles]]. for related terms, see: [[diagnosis/systemic collapse\|systemic collapse]], [[responses/lab/permacomputing\|permacomputing]], [[concepts/regen/regenerative lifestyles\|regenerative lifestyles]]... proceed at your own peril)

##### a few relevant quotes/excerpts:

> There is a 99% correlation between GPD and energy use globally. Globally, there is a 0,99 correlation between energy and GDP, and there's a 100% correlation between materials and GDP. We're increasing the offer of renewable energy faster than GDP, that's why there's a slight dissociation between GDP and CO2. Still, CO2 reaches historical records as we try to decarbonize. We will need to reorganize our materials matrix, and this will have several impacts, especially for countries in the global South and for the environment.

> 77 percent of agricultural land (some 40 million square km \[15.4 million square miles]\) is used for grazing byÂ [cattle](https://www.britannica.com/animal/cattle-livestock),Â [sheep](https://www.britannica.com/animal/domesticated-sheep),Â [goats](https://www.britannica.com/animal/goat), and [otherÂ livestock](https://www.britannica.com/animal/livestock). This massive conversion of forests,Â [wetlands](https://www.britannica.com/science/wetland),Â [grasslands](https://www.britannica.com/science/grassland), and other terrestrial ecosystems has produced a 60 percent decline (on average) in the number ofÂ [vertebrates](https://www.britannica.com/animal/vertebrate)Â worldwide since 1970.
