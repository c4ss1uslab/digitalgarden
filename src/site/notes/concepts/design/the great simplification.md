a [[theory\|theory]] proposed by [[nate hagens\|nate hagens]] and the [[institute for energy and our future\|institute for energy and our future]]. it states that we're heading towards a great simplification of our lifestyles and societies in the near (50-100-year) future, driven primarily by our unconscious use of the [[energy\|energy]] and [[materials\|materials]] of our planet and construction of extremely fragile and complicated supply chains/civilizational systems (and therefore we're quickly heading towards shortage/depletion and exponentially-increasing risks of collapse).

it's also the name of the podcast [[nate hagens\|nate hagens]] hosts around the topic.

an amazing introduction to the subject: [A Systems Approach Towards a (More) Sustainable Future: An Invitation to Academia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bE7Bbnvf4ko).

##### context

the video above is one the #top3 videos i've watched in 2024. it really opened my eyes to the material/energetic layer that permeates all aspects of our lives, and how the "green"/[[energy transition\|energy transition]] isn't happening at all and isn't hinting that it will anytime soon. we have a major "[[energy blindness\|energy blindness]]" as a society. there are certain almost dogmatic [[climate tribes\|climate tribes]] defending their viewpoint as the only valid one, and if we want to survive and thrive while stewarding a 8-billion person civilization, it seems that we need a wide range of new approaches to enable a major [[phase shift\|phase shift]] in how we see and handle our [[energy\|energy]] use.

it goes beyond the common [[climate change\|climate change]] narrative that's often about [[CO2 emission\|CO2 emission]], [[biodiversity loss\|biodiversity loss]], [[coral preservation\|coral preservation]], etc, and present an outlook looking at the many different interconnected variables. in a sense, it's similar to the [[degrowth\|degrowth]] narrative, yet way less climate-centric, and more considering of the whole set of systemic effects ([[mass migration\|mass migration]], [[AI risk\|AI risk]], [[cultural breakdown\|cultural breakdown]], etc).

(eye-opening content that's making me reconsider the [[ethics\|ethics]] of all of our [[topics/lab/technology development\|technology development]] and [[_004_L1F3/core concepts/lifestyles\|lifestyles]]. for related terms, see: [[topics/architect;design/civilizational collapse\|civilizational collapse]], [[responses/regen/permacomputing\|permacomputing]], [[regenerative lifestyles\|regenerative lifestyles]]... proceed at your own peril)

##### a few relevant quotes/excerpts:

> 77 percent of agricultural land (some 40 million square km [15.4 million square miles]) is used for grazing byÂ cattle (https://www.britannica.com/animal/cattle-livestock),Â sheep (https://www.britannica.com/animal/domesticated-sheep),Â goats (https://www.britannica.com/animal/goat), and otherÂ livestock (https://www.britannica.com/animal/livestock). This massive conversion of forests,Â wetlands (https://www.britannica.com/science/wetland),Â graslands (https://www.britannica.com/science/grassland), and other terrestrial ecosystems has produced a 60 percent decline (on average) in the number ofÂ vertebrates (https://www.britannica.com/animal/vertebrate)Â worldwide since 1970.
