when we talk about systems design, the awesome folks at [[initiatives, orgs & communities/design/the consilience project\|the consilience project]] already talk at length about how all design is actually [[responses/design/axiological design\|values-driven]]. some sciences like [[topics/design/systems science\|systems science]], [[complexity science\|complexity science]], [[topics/lab/cybernetics\|cybernetics]], [[concepts/regen/biomimicry\|biomimicry]], among others, research how to design in accordance with the properties and ethics of living/complex systems.

however, besides these attempts at understanding systems from different lenses and engaging with the [[_002_core notes/design philosophies\|design philosophies]] that exist, a question has always stayed with me:

> what are the foundational systems we're embedded in, as individuals and as civilizations?

i'd love to find/develop a [[taxonomy\|taxonomy]] of major systems within say, the [[concepts/design/superstructure\|superstructure]], [[social structure\|social structure]], [[concepts/design/infrastructure\|infrastructure]] frame, proposed by [[people/references/architect;design/marvin harris\|marvin harris]]/[[people/references/architect;design/daniel schmachtenberger\|daniel schmachtenberger]] (and further [[models & frameworks/design/holistic cultural materialism\|built upon]] by [[people/references/architect;design/andrea farias\|andrea farias]]).

a few initiatives that work on [[topics/design/systems change\|systems transformation]] seem more geared towards a few:

-  [[initiatives, orgs & communities/design/SEEDS (ecosystem)\|SEEDS]]: [[economic systems\|economic systems]], [[topics/design/governance systems\|governance systems]], [[organizational systems\|organizational systems]], [[financial systems\|financial systems]]
- [[people/references/architect;design/ashley hodgson\|ashley hodgson]]: [[economic systems\|economic systems]], [[topics/design/governance systems\|governance systems]], [[knowledge systems\|knowledge systems]]
- [[dark matter labs\|dark matter labs]]: [[ontology & epistemology\|ontology & epistemology]], [[money & valuation logic\|money & valuation logic]], [[financial processes & investment\|financial processes & investment]], [[ownership, law & governance\|ownership, law & governance]], [[institutional logic & policy\|institutional logic & policy]], [[material, energy & land use\|material, energy & land use]]
- (more to be added soon...)

i tend to use: [[belief & value systems\|belief & value systems]], [[economic systems\|economic systems]], [[topics/design/governance systems\|governance systems]], [[organizational systems\|organizational systems]], [[financial systems\|financial systems]], [[information systems\|information systems]], [[ecological systems\|ecological systems]], [[physical & digital systems\|physical & digital systems]] and [[self-management systems\|self-management systems]]. seeing these as different [[topics/design/coordination systems\|coordination]], [[terms/collaboration\|collaboration]], [[life support systems\|life support]] and [[player systems\|player/gameplay systems]] (macro categories).

however, these are still very loose categories, with no strong empirical basis. one of my main challenges/goals is to develop a stronger ontological grounding for that. i feel it'd really help me understand our civilizational & local systemic [[_005_MOCs/025 🔷 long game/030 ⛰ challenges & framing MOC\|challenges]] and [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1us’ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/archive/1 - on hold-waiting for/Porter's Generic Strategies - Choosing Your Route to Success/Untitled/Opportunities\|opportunities]] as well as challenging/strengthening my [[_002_core notes/theories of change\|theory of change]] for the [[_003_L1F3/L1F3 support systems\|L1F3 support systems]].

i still feel like i'm crawling on this though. would love to learn more, especially from folks like [[people/references/architect;design/daniel schmachtenberger\|daniel schmachtenberger]], [[nora bateson\|nora bateson]] and [[indy johar\|indy johar]].
