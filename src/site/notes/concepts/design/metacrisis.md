the "metacrisis" view points towards the perception that the set of interconnected - social, climatic, mental health, political crises of our time share a same root cause - same underlying [[diagnosis/generator functions of existential risk\|generator functions]].

it's a particular description of the *human predicament* that can help us better analyze/navigate the complexity of the times we're living and understand the [uniquely challenging state of the world]()* (to add first principles stuff) in this particular moment in the history of human civilizations.

many philosophers, cognitive scientists, spiritual teachers, have been convening around this term to make sense of the situation we've found ourselves in.

one of the best introductions i found is this 11-minute video by [[people/references/architect;design/ashley hodgson\|ashley hodgson]]: [What is the Metacrisis? Why is it Hopeful?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgCHqyq4LHA). i highly recommend you watch it.

[[references/alchemy/first principles and first values\|first principles and first values - forty-two propositions on cosmoerotic humanism, the meta-crisis and the world to come]] - the authors propose that at the root of the metacrisis, there's an [[diagnosis/intimacy crisis\|intimacy crisis]]. a crisis of disconnection. of ourselves, of the other, of the planet - and primarily, of the [[field of value\|field of value]] (which is different but very close to what's often times referred to as "the [[sacred\|sacred]]" or "the [[true\|true]], the [[good\|good]] and the [[beautiful\|beautiful]]" by other [[topics/alchemy/spiritual lineages\|wisdom traditions]]).

*definition i use:* the metacrisis is, that seem to be leading us towards any or a mixture of these: a) impending [[topics/architect;design/systemic collapse\|systemic collapse]] as we approach planetary boundaries, b) authoritarian modes of damage control or c) transition into more [[topics/architect;design/regeneration\|regenerative]], mature, resilient [[topics/architect;design/systems\|systems]], [[_004_L1F3/core concepts/civilization design\|civilizations]] and [[_004_L1F3/core concepts/lifestyles\|lifestyles]].

#### main references

##### why learn about it

the concept of the metacrisis and the analyses of several people in the space help elucidate the underlying dynamics of our current dominant [[diagnosis/generator functions of existential risk\|generator functions of existential risk]]

if we say we care about . we might not do anything in particular to address that, but broadening our [[horizon of care\|horizon of care]] is a practice that many wisdom traditions

i strongly recommend checking out [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj8H7uBaUwDvd18QrEPugPMD5Z6Y0W-vB) that i curated (30h of content).

https://www.sloww.co/meta-crisis-101/ - the deepest / most multi-perspectival introduction to it, though quite dense, especially for first timers. i recommend checking out some of [[people/references/architect;design/daniel schmachtenberger\|daniel schmachtenberger]]'s videos on the playlist above before, as a more palatable introduction.

https://metacrisis.org/ - a meta-resource - links to lots of other great content and resources.

https://wiki.metacrisis.xyz/ - a great and extensive index of perspectives for diagnosis, response patterns and projects addressing multiple parts of it.

https://metacrisis.xyz/ - a few particularly influential folks trying to curate, articulate and coordinate around the metacrisis.

https://www.gameb.wiki/ - a wiki with not a lot, but very relevant content, great for rabbit hole investigations/deep dives.

###### an incomplete yet useful way to break down the metacrisis

i found it useful to highlight 5 "core", interdependent crises underpinning the metacrisis:

the [[areas/spiritual\|spiritual]]/[[psychological\|psychological]], [[ecological\|ecological]], [[political\|political]], [[economic\|economic]] and [[educational\|educational]] crises.

which can then be broken down into several other crisis and dynamics:

-> spiritual/psychological -> [[diagnosis/mental health crisis\|mental health]], [[diagnosis/meaning crisis\|meaning]], [[diagnosis/existential crisis\|existential]], [[diagnosis/intimacy crisis\|intimacy crisis]], etc...
-> ecological -> [[concepts/design/health crisis\|health]], [[diagnosis/climate crisis\|climate]], [[diagnosis/energy crisis\|energy crisis]], etc...
-> political -> [[diagnosis/legitimacy crisis\|legitimacy crisis]], [[concepts/design/coordination failure\|coordination failure]], [[geopolitical risks\|geopolitical risks]], etc...
-> economic -> [[diagnosis/financial collapse\|financial collapse]], [[technological risk\|technological risk]], [[concepts/design/capability crisis\|capability crisis]], [[perverse incentives\|perverse incentives]], etc...
-> educational -> [[diagnosis/sensemaking crisis\|sensemaking]], [[topics/alchemy/wisdom crisis\|wisdom crisis]], [[trust crisis\|trust crisis]], etc...

they loosely map into the [[models & frameworks/design/four quadrants\|four quadrants]]/[[models & frameworks/framework variations/5 elements\|5 elements]] framework, which helps to navigate/coordinate around it. they are crises of different inter-relating dimensions ([[inner\|inner]], [[outer\|outer]], [[individual\|individual]], [[collective\|collective]]).
