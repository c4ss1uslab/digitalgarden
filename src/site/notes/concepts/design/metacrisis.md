#### about

the term "metacrisis" [was coined by philosophers](https://deeptransformation.io/nicholas-hedlund-sean-esbjorn-hargens-1-grappling-with-the-metacrisis/) [[nicholas hedlund\|nicholas hedlund]] and [[sean esbjörn-hargens\|sean esbjörn-hargens]], and has been further adopted by a loosely associated community of big picture thinkers, spiritual practitioners, cognitive scientists, regenerative activists, systems change facilitators and more, often also gathering around the terms [[responses/alchemy/metamodernism\|metamodernism]], [[responses/alchemy/integral theory\|integral theory]] and [[topics/design/regeneration\|regeneration]], with [[people/references/architect;design/daniel schmachtenberger\|daniel schmachtenberger]] probably being the most well-known spokesperson. (see: [life itself's ecosystem map](https://secondrenaissance.net/publications/overview-ecosystem-names) for an overview of associated/adjacent communities)

the term has several different definitions (which i explore more below), but the one i like the most sees it as pointing towards the perception that **the set of interconnected crises of our time - social, ecological, economic, political, informational, existential - might share a same root cause, the same underlying set of [[diagnosis/generator functions of existential risk\|generator functions]].**

there are other terms often used by other researchers and practitioners that point to similar perspectives, such as [[concepts/design/polycrisis\|polycrisis]] and the [[anthropocene\|anthropocene]], however the body of work that has been emerging out of the "metacrisis" space provides the deepest and broadest analyses i've found of our present [[human predicament\|human predicament]], which can help us navigate the complexity and make informed decisions to address the uniquely challenging state of the world.

i.e., in short: i use the term "metacrisis" to refer to our human condition of growing [[concepts/design/existential risk\|existential]] and [[terms/catastrophic risk\|catastrophic risks]] propelled by recurring [[concepts/design/coordination failure\|coordination failures]] in trying to address the [[diagnosis/generator functions of existential risk\|root causes]] of [[systemic degeneration\|systemic degeneration]] and the need to redesign our [[civilizational systems\|civilizational systems]] as [[omni-win systems\|omni-considerate]] ones, if we're to be [[concepts/alchemy/wisdom\|wise]] stewards of the first truly global society in the history of human civilizations.

the many different perspectives on the metacrisis seem to converge to two conclusions:

at the core of the metacrisis there's 1) the dominant [[topics/alchemy/metaphysics\|metaphysics]], [[concepts/alchemy/ontology\|ontology]] and [[ways of living\|ways of living]] of our culture being disconnected from [[concepts/design/value\|value]], [[sacredness\|sacredness]], and a sense of [[interdependence\|interdependence]] with each other and with [[nature\|nature]] itself, and consequently 2) a [[diagnosis/self-terminating economic system\|socioeconomic system]] that predates on its own [[models & frameworks/design/holistic cultural materialism\|life support systems]] (ecological substrate).

#### why learn about it

upon coming into contact with the term, i notice many people feel intimidated/overwhelmed by it. "aren't we doing much better than in the past?" "i don't want to be thinking about the times we're living as a crisis, it seems too negative." and while there are many other perspectives in the space that emphasize the brightest aspects of our times ([[from crisis to crossing\|from crisis to crossing]], the [[great transition\|great transition]], the [[tbprocessed/base notes/concepts - general/regenerative renaissance\|regenerative renaissance]], a [[responses/design/second renaissance\|second renaissance]], etc) i found that there's a very good reason to use this term.

> when you stay with the perception that for many people around the world - alive now and in the world to come - these crises are or will be very present in their immediate reality, and **there might be [[diagnosis/generator functions of existential risk\|a limited set of specific underlying dynamics]] that are determining vast majority of the outcomes of our prevalent systems**, there's enormous hope and energy that we might actually be able to recognize it and design better ones. it can be very powerful and liberating to see that.
> 
> there's a lot of work in trying to understand what's really going on, balancing the different perspectives, interests, power struggles, etc. however, if we want to survive and thrive as a species, at this moment, we're both uniquely challenged and prepared to do so as well. the more perspectives, and the more ways to navigate them, the better.

unfortunately, it's very common to maintain attitudes of indifference/complacency or resignation from the struggle of dealing with/working on transforming the dominant [[power structures\|power structures]]. if we say we care about life on earth - be it only our dear friends/family, humanity at large, animals, plants, and/or all beings - we have a responsibility to care for it. collectively, we are not doing nearly enough, letting outdated systems of command and control bring out the worst of us and limit both our actions and our imaginations.

we might feel powerless to address all of that, but broadening our [[horizon of care\|horizon of care]] and slowly developing capacity to hold the complexity of what's going on and maintain a healthy conduct is a practice that [[topics/alchemy/spiritual lineages\|wisdom traditions]] seem to be proposing since the beginning of our history.

#### recommended resources

one of the simplest introductions i found is this 11-minute video by [[people/references/architect;design/ashley hodgson\|ashley hodgson]]: [What is the Metacrisis? Why is it Hopeful?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgCHqyq4LHA).

if you want to get started diving into this content, i strongly recommend checking out [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj8H7uBaUwDvd18QrEPugPMD5Z6Y0W-vB) that i curated, interwoven with the other text-centric resources i list below.

this introductory infographic also sums it up in somewhat nicely (with some account for the tech-centric bias/propositions of the creators):

other references that are briefly introduced in the playlist and that deserve very considerate readings are:

[[references/alchemy/first principles and first values\|first principles and first values - forty-two propositions on cosmoerotic humanism, the meta-crisis and the world to come]]⁹⁶ - a must read. the authors propose that at the root of the metacrisis, there's an [[diagnosis/intimacy crisis\|intimacy crisis]]⁹⁷. a crisis of disconnection. of ourselves, of the other, of the planet - and primarily, of the [[field of value\|field of value]] (which is different but very close to what's often times referred to as "the [[sacred\|sacred]]" or "the [[true\|true]], the [[good\|good]] and the [[beautiful\|beautiful]]" by other [[topics/alchemy/spiritual lineages\|wisdom traditions]]). this, in turn, has deep consequences in the design of pretty much every dominant system and institution in our society today, leading to the many crises we're witnessing.

[[people/references/architect;design/andrea farias\|andrea farias]] ([[projects & tools/projects/design/diome.xyz\|diome.xyz]]⁹⁶), [[people/references/regen/vanessa andreotti\|vanessa andreotti]]⁹⁶ ([[_009_notes & highlights from books, videos, articles/hospicing modernity\|hospicing modernity]]) and [[initiatives, orgs & communities/regen/culture hack labs\|culture hack labs]]⁹⁵ ([[post capitalist philanthropy\|post capitalist philanthropy]] & their [issues](https://www.culturehack.io/issues/)) also evidence the underlying systems dynamics of the [[concepts/design/metacrisis\|metacrisis]] in different but similar ways.

###### other powerful perspectives include:

[[zak stein\|zak stein]] - [education is the metacrisis - manifesto for the transformative education alliance](https://systems-souls-society.com/education-is-the-metacrisis/) - one of the best breakdowns of the metacrisis + very powerful, clear, inspiring writing

[[people/references/alchemy/john vervaeke\|john vervaeke]] - [[diagnosis/meaning crisis\|meaning crisis]]⁹⁷ - lots of good content from around it, more useful for understanding/navigating the (inner) psychological crises of our time.

[[jonathan rowson\|jonathan rowson]] - [tasting the pickle: ten flavours of meta-crisis and the appetite for a new civilisation](https://systems-souls-society.com/tasting-the-pickle-ten-flavours-of-meta-crisis-and-the-appetite-for-a-new-civilisation/)

[[josh williams\|josh williams]]'s [an introduction to the metacrisis](https://sites.google.com/view/intro-to-the-metacrisis) introduces it pretty well especially from the perspective of [[terms/catastrophic risk\|catastrophic]] and [[concepts/design/existential risk\|existential risks]].

[[josh field\|josh field]] - [[concepts/design/flow crisis\|flow crisis]]⁹⁷ - a few less-known but very interesting/valuable perspectives on it.

[life itself ecosystem map](https://ecosystem.lifeitself.us/) - a pretty good map of the organizations/communities in the space.

###### a few extensive websites/compilations:

https://www.sloww.co/meta-crisis-101/ - the deepest / most multi-perspectival introduction to it, though quite dense, especially for first timers. i recommend checking out some of [[people/references/architect;design/daniel schmachtenberger\|daniel schmachtenberger]]'s videos on the playlist i mentioned before, as a more palatable introduction.

https://metacrisis.org/ - a meta-resource - links to lots of other great content and resources.

https://wiki.metacrisis.xyz/ - a great and extensive index of perspectives for diagnosis, response patterns and projects addressing multiple parts of it.

https://metacrisis.xyz/ - a few particularly influential folks trying to curate, articulate and coordinate around the metacrisis.

https://www.gameb.wiki/ - a wiki with not a lot, but very relevant content, great for rabbit hole investigations/deep dives.

###### an incomplete yet useful way to break down the metacrisis

i found it useful to highlight 5 "core", interdependent crises underpinning the metacrisis:

the [[areas/spiritual\|spiritual]]/[[psychological\|psychological]], [[ecological\|ecological]], [[political\|political]], [[economic\|economic]] and [[educational\|educational]] crises.

which can then be broken down into several other crisis and dynamics:

-> spiritual/psychological -> [[mental health crisis\|mental health]], [[diagnosis/meaning crisis\|meaning]], [[diagnosis/existential crisis\|existential]], [[diagnosis/intimacy crisis\|intimacy crisis]], etc...
-> ecological -> [[concepts/design/health crisis\|health]], [[diagnosis/climate crisis\|climate]], [[diagnosis/energy crisis\|energy crisis]], etc...
-> political -> [[diagnosis/legitimacy crisis\|legitimacy crisis]], [[concepts/design/coordination failure\|coordination failure]], [[geopolitical risks\|geopolitical risks]], etc...
-> economic -> [[diagnosis/financial collapse\|financial collapse]], [[technological risk\|technological risk]], [[concepts/design/capability crisis\|capability crisis]], [[perverse incentives\|perverse incentives]], etc...
-> educational -> [[diagnosis/sensemaking crisis\|sensemaking]], [[topics/alchemy/wisdom crisis\|wisdom crisis]], [[trust crisis\|trust crisis]], etc...

they loosely map into the [[models & frameworks/design/four quadrants\|four quadrants]]/[[models & frameworks/framework variations/5 elements\|5 elements]] framework, which helps to navigate/coordinate around it. they are crises of different inter-relating dimensions ([[inner\|inner]], [[outer\|outer]], [[individual\|individual]], [[collective\|collective]]).
