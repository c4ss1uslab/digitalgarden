the metacrisis is a lens for analyzing/understanding the *human predicament* and the complexity of our current moment in the history of civilizations.

*definition i use:* the metacrisis is the set of interconnected, interdependent crises of our time, that seem to be leading us towards any or a mixture of these: a) impending [[topics/architect;design/civilizational collapse\|systemic collapse]] as we approach planetary boundaries, b) authoritarian modes of damage control or c) transition into more [[topics/architect;design/regeneration\|regenerative]], mature, antifragile civilizations and [[_004_L1F3/core concepts/lifestyles\|lifestyles]].

###### main references

i strongly recommend checking out [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj8H7uBaUwDvd18QrEPugPMD5Z6Y0W-vB) that i curated (30h of content).

https://www.sloww.co/meta-crisis-101/ - the deepest / most multi-perspectival introduction to it, though quite dense, especially for first timers. i recommend checking out some of [[people/references/architect;design/daniel schmachtenberger\|daniel schmachtenberger]]'s videos on the playlist above before, as a more palatable introduction.

https://metacrisis.org/ - a meta-resource - links to lots of other great content and resources.

https://wiki.metacrisis.xyz/ - a great and extensive index of perspectives for diagnosis, response patterns and projects addressing multiple parts of it.

https://metacrisis.xyz/ - a few particularly influential folks trying to curate, articulate and coordinate around the metacrisis.

https://www.gameb.wiki/ - a wiki with not a lot, but very relevant content, great for rabbit hole investigations/deep dives.

###### an incomplete yet useful way to break down the metacrisis

i found it useful to highlight 5 "core", interdependent crises underpinning the metacrisis:

the [[areas/spiritual\|spiritual]]/[[psychological\|psychological]], [[ecological\|ecological]], [[political\|political]], [[economic\|economic]] and [[educational\|educational]] crises.

which can then be broken down into several other crisis and dynamics:

-> spiritual/psychological -> [[mental health crisis\|mental health]], [[concepts/alchemy/meaning crisis\|meaning]], [[concepts/alchemy/existential crisis\|existential]], [[concepts/design/intimacy crisis\|intimacy crisis]], etc...
-> ecological -> [[concepts/design/health crisis\|health]], [[topics/architect;design/climate crisis\|climate]], [[topics/architect;design/energy crisis\|energy crisis]], etc...
-> political -> [[concepts/design/legitimacy crisis\|legitimacy crisis]], [[concepts/design/coordination failure\|coordination failure]], [[geopolitical risks\|geopolitical risks]], etc...
-> economic -> [[topics/architect;design/financial crisis\|financial crisis]], [[technological risk\|technological risk]], [[concepts/design/capability crisis\|capability crisis]], [[perverse incentives\|perverse incentives]], etc...
-> educational -> [[concepts/design/sensemaking crisis\|sensemaking]], [[topics/alchemy/wisdom crisis\|wisdom crisis]], [[trust crisis\|trust crisis]], etc...

they loosely map into the [[models & frameworks/design/four quadrants\|four quadrants]]/[[models & frameworks/framework variations/5 elements\|5 elements]] framework, which helps to navigate/coordinate around it. they are crises of different inter-relating dimensions ([[inner\|inner]], [[outer\|outer]], [[individual\|individual]], [[collective\|collective]]).
