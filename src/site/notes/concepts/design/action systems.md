##### 1) [[talcott parsons\|talcott parsons]]' [action systems & social systems](https://www.csun.edu/~snk1966/Talcott%20Parsons%20-%20Action%20Systems%20and%20Social%20Systems.htm):

> We consider **social systems** to be constituents ofÂ the more general system of action, the other primary constituents being **cultural systems, personality systems, and behavioral organisms**; all four are abstractly defined relative to the concrete behavior of social interaction.

> The distinctions among the fourÂ **subsystems of action**Â are functional. We draw them in terms of theÂ four primary functions which we impute to all systems of action, namelyÂ [[pattern-maintenance\|pattern-maintenance]], [[integration\|integration]], [[goal-attainment\|goal-attainment]], and [[adaptation\|adaptation]].

> An action system's primary integrative problem is the **coordination of its constituent units**, in the first instance human individuals, though for certain purposes collectivities may be treated as actors. Hence, we attributeÂ primacy of integrative function to the social system.

> We attributeÂ primacy of pattern-maintenance--and of creative pattern change--to theÂ cultural system.

> WhereasÂ social systems are organized with primary reference to the articulation of social relationships,Â cultural systems are organized around the characteristics of complexes of symbolic meanings--the codes in terms of which they are structured, the particular clusters of symbols they employ, and the conditions of their utilization, maintenance, and change as parts of action systems.

> We attributeÂ primacy of goal-attainmentÂ to theÂ personality of the individual. The personality system is the primaryÂ _agency_Â of action processes, hence of the implementation of cultural principles and requirements. On the level of reward in the motivational sense the optimization of gratification or satisfaction to personalities is the primary goal of action.

> TheÂ behavioral organismÂ is conceived as theÂ adaptiveÂ **subsystem**, the locus of the primary human facilities which underlie the other systems. It embodies a set of conditions to which action must adapt and comprises the primary mechanism of interrelation with the physical environment, especially through the input and processing of information in the central nervous system and through motor activity in coping with exigencies of the physical environment. These relationships are presented systematically in Table 1.

##### my loose one:

systems that directly enable human action.
