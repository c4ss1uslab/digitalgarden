when i talk about personal tech stacks, i'm referring to the aggregate of all hardware and software you use. in an ideal world, we would always have [[local-first\|local-first]], [[agent-centric\|agent-centric]], [[humane\|humane]] [[topics/lab/free open-source software\|free open-source software]] and [[open hardware\|open hardware]], but that's not always feasible.

so a powerful outcome of taking a critical look at every piece of technology we use/create is having tremendous clarity on what trade-offs we're choosing to make as an effect our relationship with that tech.

so, before looking at exactly what a "personal tech stack" might look like, let's briefly outline the 2 major approaches to (humane) tech stack design.

#### 2 approaches to tech stack design

1) create on top of the new, emergent decentralized/distributed architecture ([[topics/architect;design/web3\|web3]]/[[projects & tools/tools/design/IPFS\|IPFS]]/[[initiatives, orgs & communities/lab/holochain\|holochain]]/[[prototypes/made by others/synapsis\|synapsis]] promise), knowing that it's going to take a lot more work and some features won't be available, and/or
2) find ways to minimize the negative effects and adapt the existing systems/tools to be more intentional/humane/regenerative.

while we don't have the best of both worlds, we still have unmet functions - a goal of my curation is to bring clarity to that, to establish knowledge/resource commons and coordinate efforts.

for a long time, i've been trying to curate the "[[experiments/made by me/design/minimum viable intentional personal systems setup\|minimum viable intentional personal systems setup]]", which includes the tech stack. here's what i've been currently using: [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss1us' tech stack notion database\|c4ss1us' tech stack notion database]]

for a deeper exploration into both of these, see:

- **approach 2: [[adapting existing systems\|adapting existing systems]]**

- other tools for:
	- communication, learning, sensemaking, publishing, processing, scraping, etc...
###### mobile:

- [[operating system\|operating system]]
- [[apps\|apps]]
- [[widgets\|widgets]]

at some point, i'd like to tag these with metadata - their ecological footprint (both what was necessary for building it and for continuing to use it), and for software - their size and usage data (included in [[topics/lab/quantified self\|quantified self]] tracking).
