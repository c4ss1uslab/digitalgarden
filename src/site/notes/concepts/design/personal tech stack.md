see: [[_004_L1F3/core concepts/life design\|life design]], [[experiments/minimum viable intentional personal systems setup\|minimum viable intentional personal systems setup]]

when i talk about personal tech stacks, i'm referring to both hardware and software. the intention is to always have [[local-first\|local-first]], [[agent-centric\|agent-centric]], [[humane\|humane]] [[topics/lab/free open-source software\|free open-source software]] and [[open hardware\|open hardware]], but that's not always possible.

so, what trade-offs will we choose to take as we design our relationship with technology?

tools such as:

hardware:
- [[phone\|phone]]
- [[laptop\|laptop]]
- [[tablet\|tablet]]
- [[wearables\|wearables]]
- other [[electronic tools\|electronic tools]]
	- [[raspberry pi\|raspberry pi]]
	- [[arduino\|arduino]]
	- etc

software:
- [[operating system\|operating system]]
- [[desktop environment\|desktop environment]]
- [[RSS\|RSS]] / aggregators
- [[topics/lab/recommender systems\|recommender systems]] / curation feeds
- [[social graphs\|social graphs]]
- [[browser\|browser]]
- [[bookmark manager\|bookmark manager]]
- [[file manager\|file manager]]
- [[note-taking apps\|note-taking apps]]
	+ plugins (excalidraw, juggl...)
- [[drawing/diagramming\|drawing/diagramming]] apps
- [[self-tracking\|self-tracking]] tools
- other tools for:
	- communication, learning, sensemaking, publishing, processing, scraping, etc...

at which level does each tool operate?
[[data\|data]] -> [[terms/information\|information]] -> [[knowledge\|knowledge]] -> [[creativity\|creativity]] -> [[concepts/alchemy/wisdom\|wisdom]] (content layers)
â€” other useful frames/breakdowns: [[terms/action\|action]], [[_002_toolkit/008 ðŸ•¹ decision hub\|decision]], [[thoughts\|thoughts]], [[plans\|plans]], [[strategies\|strategies]]...

there are 2 approaches to tech stack design:

1) we create on top of the new, emergent decentralized/distributed architecture ([[web3 1\|web3 1]]/[[projects & tools/tools/design/IPFS\|IPFS]]/[[initiatives, orgs & communities/lab/holochain\|holochain]]/[[urbit\|urbit]]/[[prototypes/not proprietary/synapsis\|synapsis]] promise), knowing that it's going to take a lot more work, and
2) we find ways to minimize the negative effects and adapt the existing systems/tools to be more intentional/conscious/regenerative.
 
while we don't have such functional systems, we still have unmet functions. bring clarity to that, to establish knowledge/resource commons.

for a long time, i've been trying to curate the "[[experiments/minimum viable intentional personal systems setup\|minimum viable intentional personal systems setup]]", which includes the tech stack.

so here's what i've been using: [[_005_c4ss1us/c4ss1us' tech stack notion database\|c4ss1us' tech stack notion database]]

##### approach 1: new (experimental/early-stage) systems

https://trust.support/feed/moving-castles


##### approach 2: adapting existing systems

https://jon.bo/posts/digital-tools/ -> experiments: omnichannel curation feed - queue management, (+social) recommendation system, intelligent (adaptable to self) media displayer, centralized search interface (org-mode approach: https://beepb00p.xyz/pkm-search.html). missing: AI agent, etc
