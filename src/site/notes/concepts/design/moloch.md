when we think about "what is wrong with our existing civilization?", it seems very clear that "moloch" is a big part of the problem.

it is a mythological word for an entity that represents/carries the concept of [[perverse incentives\|perverse incentives]] - be they conscious or not. it is also sometimes referred to as "the god of [[topics/player/game theory\|negative sum games]]", or the sum of our [[collective action failures\|collective action failures]].

but better than me explaining it, are these resources:

**a good intro:** (20-min video)

\*the edit style at the beginning of the video can feel a little overwhelming/sensationalist, but it stops being so and actually introduces it very well after the first 1m30s.

**my favorite exploration of the subject:** (1h30 podcast)
