when we think about "what is wrong with our existing civilization?", i'm quite sure moloch is a big part of the answer.

it could be conceptualized as unintentional or unconscious [[perverse incentives\|perverse incentives]]. it is also sometimes referred to as "the god of [[concepts/design/coordination failure\|coordination failure]]", or the sum of our [[collective action failures\|collective action failures]].

but better than me explaining it, are these resources:

**my favorite exploration of the subject:** (1h30 podcast)

strongly related to: [[tragedy of the commons\|tragedy of the commons]], [[terms/catastrophic risk\|catastrophic risk]], [[concepts/design/existential risk\|existential risk]].
