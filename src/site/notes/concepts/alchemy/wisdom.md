what is wisdom? a distillation across multiple [[topics/alchemy/spiritual lineages\|wisdom traditions]]:

##### simplest definition framed by [[people/references/design/nicolas michaelsen\|nicolas michaelsen]]:

it's the integration of different [[concepts/alchemy/ways of knowing\|ways of knowing]] (below based on [[people/references/alchemy/john vervaeke\|john vervaeke]]'s [[models & frameworks/alchemy/4Ps;3R theory of cognition\|4Ps framework]]).

a great, simple and short introduction here: [What is Wisdom?](https://ecologiesofwisdom.substack.com/p/what-is-wisdom)
##### [[people/references/alchemy/john vervaeke\|john vervaeke]]'s 10-min presentation on it:

##### [[respond network\|respond network]]'s theory of wisdom:
(a lot of people whose work i respect and am constantly learning more about)

> "Respond’s theory of wisdom has two basic principles:
>
> 🧙 **Wisdom** is a process of harmonizing 👁️ **View**, ❤️ **Care**, and 🤲 **Action**.
>
> 🧙 **Wisdom** deepens by 📻 **Tuning In** to 🪴 **Well-being** in 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Relationship**.
>
> The following articles outline a **Theory** of wisdom. A theory is not a definition, but rather a set of principles that explain an activity—in this case, the process of becoming “more wise”.
> 
> Respond’s theory of wisdom is a compression of the vast and wide-ranging work of our members. It enables you to talk about wisdom in plain language. The theory will also help you see important connections among the specific teachings."

##### [[people/references/design/tom morgan\|tom morgan]]'s presentations:

from [[the leading edge\|the leading edge]]'s [accelerating wisdom series](https://www.theleading-edge.org/accelerating-wisdom-series/):

> A [recent study](https://bmcpsychology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40359-024-01905-4?ref=theleading-edge.org) found that _“Wisdom is the best predictor of life satisfaction in both men and women and can offset the influence of negative age on life satisfaction. Wisdom has a greater influence on life satisfaction in older adulthood than health, socioeconomic status, financial situation, environment, or social engagement.”_
> 
> [Thirty years of wisdom research](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/17456916221114096?ref=theleading-edge.org) has shown that it correlates with hedonic wellbeing (how good you feel) and eudaimonic wellbeing (how much you’re growing). Wisdom means always knowing what’s most important, what to focus on in every different situation. This means the pursuit of wisdom both reduces your anxiety and increases your sense of purpose. In short; wisdom is the ability to pursue what you love and ignore what you don't.
> 
> Surprisingly, wisdom doesn’t correlate that strongly with either age or intelligence. While our intelligence tends to peak in our early 20s, the pursuit of wisdom has no upper limits. If we choose to focus on it, wisdom can even be accelerated.
> 
> It’s obvious that the pursuit of wisdom can meaningfully improve your life, yet very few people undertake it in a deliberate way. This series and _The Leading Edge_ network is here to meet that need.
> 
> This series will not be focused on abstract ideas or philosophy (that has been done excellently elsewhere). Instead we will aim to focus solely on ideas that have immediate practical applications. In keeping with Dr. [[people/references/alchemy/iain mcgilchrist\|Iain McGilchrist]]'s revelatory work, the primary focus will be on means of rebalancing our brain's hemispheres back towards the right.

[[curiosity\|curiosity]]/fascination: can you force yourself to be interested in something?
to some degree, yes. but in the deepest sense, no.

-> this question points to a deeper reality, often evidenced by [[references/alchemy/carl jung\|jung]] and [[references/alchemy/joseph campbell\|campbell]], that there's something beyond your control that's always guiding you. this force connects you to what's intrinsically motivating and orients you towards your personal growth.
