> "Psychotechnologies is a term that describes various practices, ways of thinking and being in the world, as well as philosophical, ethical, and religious frameworks." So psychotechnologies are something like “methods of soul-craft”.

> **Psychotechnologies can be roughly categorized like so:**
> 
> 1. Individual Cognitive-Creative
> 2. Individual Somatic 
> 3. Individual Integrative
> 4. Collective Intelligence
> 5. Collective Somatic
> 6. Collective Sapience

another simpler categorization might be:

> _Let’s describe psychotechnologies with clear examples:_
> 
> 1.) **Mental** psychotech includes _speech, literacy, numeracy, metaphor, meditation,_ and _spiritual practices._
> 
> 2.) **Embodied** psychotech includes _fasting, sensory isolation, sleep deprivation, binaural beats, accupressure, breathing techniques, yoga, martial arts_, and other forms of exercise.
> 
> 3.) **Pharmacological** psychotech are compounds that modify cognition, from nootropics like _L-theanine_ and _gingko biloba,_ to _caffeine_**_,_** _cannabis,_ psilocybin_, LSD, DMT_, and many others.
