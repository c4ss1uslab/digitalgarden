i find this a very good introduction to the field, though accessible mostly for those already onboard with most of its premises (and focusing more on [[higher education\|higher education]]): [GTDF's decolonizing higher education workbook](https://decolonialfutures.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/decolonizing-he-workbook-draft-march2021-2.pdf]).

[[initiatives, orgs & communities/regen/culture hack labs\|culture hack labs]] also offers good perspectives in their [issues](https://www.culturehack.io/issues/)/[[post capitalist philanthropy\|post capitalist philanthropy]], but also in a language mostly for insiders. still trying to find the most accessible introductions!
