the mainstream understanding of human development is terrible, since it pretty much equates it social conditions enabled by economic growth. it doesn't capture any inner dimensions of development and misses what's often most important/sacred for individuals and cultures across the globe.

when we speak of [[human flourishing\|human flourishing]] or introduce frameworks such as the [[models & frameworks/alchemy/inner development goals\|inner development goals]], we start to establish a better dialogue that doesn't need to cross into esoteric/metaphysical realms, but it still often doesn't get to the essence of it.

some [[postmodern\|postmodern]] thinkers and [[indigenous\|indigenous]] activists such as [[ailton krenak\|ailton krenak]] are critics of [[terms/development\|development]], proposing [[involvement\|involvement]] as an alternative. he brings fair points, however, fields such as [[topics/alchemy/developmental psychology\|developmental psychology]] and [[responses/alchemy/metamodernism\|metamodern]]/[[responses/alchemy/integral theory\|integral]] studies show the extent to which development is still relevant/necessary.

the [[development in progress\|development in progress]] paper, for example, provides a detailed analysis of the modern/western narratives of [[progress\|progress]]/[[terms/development\|development]] and how they need to evolve to develop a [[mature\|mature]], [[holistic\|holistic]] understanding of the term. i.e. yes, there can be progress (a positive direction in which to move), but we need to be extremely mindful about what that "progress" really entails and what it is always both advantaging and deterring.

now, when it comes to this deeper understanding of human development, i have two favorite references: 

1) [[people/references/alchemy/hanzi freinacht\|hanzi freinacht]]'s [[models & frameworks/alchemy/state, code, stage, depth\|state, code, stage, depth]] model

which is very powerful yet accessible (it only requires some time investment to really understand the ins and outs of it).

2) [[people/references/alchemy/ken wilber\|ken wilber]]'s [[models & frameworks/alchemy/AQAL\|AQAL model]], with some sprinkles of [[responses/alchemy/cosmoerotic humanism\|cosmoerotic humanism]]/[[unique self\|unique self theory]] on top
 
this second one is a bit less accessible for someone with no philosophical background, but also very powerful and it can be a major stepping stone for an individual's [[awakening\|awakening]].
