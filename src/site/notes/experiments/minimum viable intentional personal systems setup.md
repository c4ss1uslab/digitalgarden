#### about

this has been a long-standing research/experiment of mine as to what is the minimum set of viable digital technologies ([[concepts/personal tech stack\|personal tech stack]]) for an [[intentional\|intentional]] [[personal computing\|personal computing]] setup.

we're talking [[desktop\|desktop]], [[mobile\|mobile]] and everything in-between.

most [[open-source\|open-source]]/[[local-first\|local-first]] apps and solutions are too technical/inaccessible for the average user, plus suffer from a much lower-quality UX and lack of development/support (mainly, of course, due to the pretty much non-existent [[financial incentives for open-source software\|financial incentives for open-source software]]).

yet i believe we drastically need to give users more [[concepts/agency\|agency]] and [[concepts/sovereignty\|sovereignty]] over their own data and [[personal systems design\|personal systems design]].

lots of [[web3 1\|web3 1]] initiatives aim to tackle this in different ways, yet though i've experimented with and follow the development of a bunch of them ([[projects & tools/tools/IPFS\|IPFS]], [[tbprocessed/base notes/ventures - general/holochain\|holochain]], [[urbit\|urbit]], even [[gitcoin\|gitcoin]] itself...) there are still many bottlenecks, unsolved technical challenges and economic incentives for them to really start replacing standard web2 infrastructure existent today.

i also find the whole [[topics/lab/free open-source software\|free open-source software]] and [[humane tech\|humane tech]] movements (unfortunately) still very limited in their scopes.

these are basically more advanced [[concepts/life management\|life management]] (and sometimes - [[topics/lab/quantified self\|quantified self]]) setups, going beyond what most advanced [[topics/lab/knowledge management\|PKM]] practitioners do, but still mostly concerned with [[personal data management\|personal data management]], and not necessarily [[topics/architect;design/life design\|regenerative life]] / [[topics/architect;design/systems design\|systems design]].

in 2020, i created a (now outdated) [[prototypes/on hold/notion personal tech stack database\|notion personal tech stack database]] as part of the [[notion life management prototype\|notion life management prototype]]. i will eventually update it with my most recent curation and setup, especially as i move it to [[anytype\|anytype]] or some other form of user-owned local software that does [[relational database\|relational database]] management (possibly [[prototypes/not proprietary/synapsis\|synapsis]], [[tbprocessed/base notes/ventures - general/obsidian\|obsidian]]/[[projects & tools/tools/logseq\|logseq]]/[[dendron\|dendron]] with plugins, or a custom solution in the future).
