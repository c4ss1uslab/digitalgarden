the surrender experiment is the name of a [[topics/alchemy/spirituality\|spiritual]] book by [[michael singer\|michael singer]]. it was recommended to me by a friend/acquaintance.

i read it, and by the end of it, i felt like it didn't really share any useful insights, besides "trusting the universe and the not knowingness", and exploring the author's journey in a biographical manner.

another friend of mine who had also read it and found it meaningful, proposed a 7-day experiment in which i lived like him - surrendering and saying yes to whatever possibilities the universe presented to me.

i did that for and reviewed how it went in more detail here: https://twitter.com/c4ss1usplayer/status/1662556338356887557

i was also exploring more deeply the [[_001_MOCs/025 🔷 long game/020 ❔ concepts, questions & ideas MOC\|concepts]] and [[distinctions\|distinctions]] proposed by [[initiatives, orgs & communities/alchemy/possibility management\|possibility management]], so i use some of its language in the review.

**conclusion:** 3/10. i don't recommend it. like [[eckhart tolle\|eckhart tolle]], i find him very confusing and not specific. if you read [[_009_notes & highlights from books, videos, articles/listening society\|listening society]], you're much better off and you'll have a much better understanding of why that's the case.
