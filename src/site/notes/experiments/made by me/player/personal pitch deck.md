instead of a resume, the personal pitch deck is a tool proposed by [[initiatives, orgs & communities/player/praxis\|praxis]] to introduce yourself and clarify your [[value proposition\|value proposition]] for any [[terms/organization\|organization]] you want to work with. i used it in 2017/18 as part of the personal/professional accelerator program to get the jobs at [metadata.io](https://metadata.io/) and then [[high stakes academy\|high stakes academy]].

it's a great tool especially if you're in the beginning of your career. it prompts you to think deeply about what you want/have to offer and how to sell yourself.

if you want an example, you can see the pitch deck i used to get the latter job here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vNqVNKoxnjleZIx2wCBG1FbMqgmJG2qJ/view
