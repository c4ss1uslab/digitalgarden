the idea is for this card to work like a business card - it's an introduction to yourself. it also aims to be a hybrid (phygital) piece of content, that could be presented with a [[prototypes/made by me/on hold/minimum viable extended self device\|minimum viable extended self device]].

it's part of a series of experiments aiming to explore interfaces that blend [[usefulness\|usefulness]] and [[shareability\|shareability]].

i only created this one at the moment. a page 2 with [[self-tracking\|self-tracking]] could look something like [[projects & tools/projects/lab/how is felix today\|how is felix today]]'s page.

having it in a more friendly format can make it like a welcome card, an introduction to that person. see:

##### notes for further development:

evidence in the player profile - what games you're playing (sourcing from obsd -> [[_004_L1F3/l1f3 management methodology\|l1f3 management methodology]])
to streamline connection.

next: metagames/missions, player menu, etc
