#### about

the idea for this experiment is for this "player card" to work like a "[[player profile\|player profile]]" in a game, or an interactive "business card" - it's an introduction to yourself. it also aims to be a hybrid (phygital) piece of content, that could be presented with a [[prototypes & designs/made by me/on hold/minimum viable extended self device\|minimum viable extended self device]].

current options are usually: a [[projects & tools/made by me/personal/personal website\|personal website]]/[[patterns/active patterns/knowledge design/digital gardening\|digital garden]] (which often requires a lot of thought/setup/maintenance), a "[[link in bio\|link in bio]]" tool/links aggregator ([[linktree\|linktree]]/[[biosites\|biosites]]) or tools that allow you to create and publish standalone pages, such as [[tbprocessed/base notes/tools;products - general/notion\|notion]], [[mmm.pages\|mmm.pages]]. (note i use all 3)

still, i feel the lack of simple tools that allow you to create interactive experiences. [[gather\|gather]] takes a shot at it enabling you to create 2d virtual worlds where you can hang out with people. [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1usâ€™ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/archive/databases/innovative projects master list/mozilla hubs\|mozilla hubs]] do so in 3d as well. some people dedicate inordinate amounts of personal time to building something like a [[digital room\|digital room]], or other kinds of fun, playful [[digital experiences\|digital experiences]].

yet most of these experiences aren't very interested in building upon resilient [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1usâ€™ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/archive/databases/general skills master list/digital infrastructure\|digital infrastructure]], [[data portability\|data portability]]/[[interoperability\|interoperability]] and using these experiences to support long-term [[knowledge-building\|knowledge-building]], [[trust development\|trust development]], [[terms/collaboration\|collaboration]] and more.

traditional [[knowledge-building\|knowledge-building]] tools such as [[wikis\|wikis]] or [[digital collaboration tools\|digital collaboration tools]] such as [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1usâ€™ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/archive/databases/sub-skills master list/miro\|miro]] or [[tbprocessed/base notes/tools;products - general/notion\|notion]] often are just commercial tools, lacking the [[terms/fun\|fun]]/[[playfulness\|playful]] aspect of it.

[[initiatives, orgs & communities/design/trust (collective)\|trust (collective)]]'s experiment on [[modular portable multiplayer miniverses\|modular portable multiplayer miniverses]] is a noteworthy reference, but they unfortunately haven't managed to move into building something accessible for the public.

##### my experiment/prototype

this is part of a series of [[_001_MOCs/050 ğŸŸ© mid game/090 ğŸ§ª experiments MOC\|experiments]] aiming to explore interfaces that blend [[usefulness\|usefulness]] and [[shareability\|shareability]] - as part of the [[_003_L1F3/core concepts/life streaming\|life streaming]] project.

below is just a mockup (v0, unreleased). the v1 ([[proof of concept\|proof of concept]]) could be hosted on something like [[figma prototypes\|figma prototypes]], [[github pages\|github pages]] or [[vercel\|vercel]]. v2 ideally on something compatible with [[low-tech\|low-tech]] devices ([[prototypes & designs/made by me/on hold/minimum viable extended self device\|minimum viable XS device]]) and [[local-first\|local-first]]/[[p2p\|p2p]] infrastructure.

i only created this one at the moment. a page 2 with [[self-tracking\|self-tracking]] data could look something like [[references/lab/how is felix today\|how is felix today]]'s page, for example.

having it in a more friendly format can make it like a welcome card, an introduction to that person. see:

#### next steps for further development:

1) evidence in the player profile: [[metagames\|metagames]] (i.e. what games you're playing in life, sourcing from obsd? -> [[_003_L1F3/l1f3 management ontology\|l1f3 management ontology]])

to streamline connection.

2) next: integrate [[_001_MOCs/025 ğŸ”· long game/035 ğŸ”­ missions MOC\|missions]], [[experiments/made by me/player/c4ss1us' player menu\|player menu]], etc
