c4ss1us.l1f3 is the main channel i created to interface with the world. just being [[experiments/made by me/player/open-source human experiment\|open-source human]] is not enough. streaming life is the process of sharing the flows (economic, informational, etc), as biological organisms in gaia.

the idea isn't to be some self-centered brand, but an open-source [[_003_L1F3/core concepts/lifestyles\|lifestyle]] that enables deeper levels of collective [[concepts/alchemy/sensemaking\|sensemaking]], [[understanding\|understanding]], [[coordination\|coordination]] and [[terms/collaboration\|collaboration]].

this experiment is the combination of 2 elements:

1) an investigation into the inquiry:

- what would life look like if we experienced ourselves as parts of larger ecosystems, and as ecosystems within ourselves?

i write about it in more detail on [this post](https://c4ss1us.substack.com/p/archetypal-living-as-a-system-and).

2) an implementation/prototype of the [[_003_L1F3/l1f3 streaming system\|l1f3 streaming system]].

if i'm a [L1F3 player](https://c4ss1us.notion.site/l1f3-players-unite-67b9592280554dc98a7e71918c1204c0), how do i want to [[stream\|stream]] my life? the technical aspect of designing my life as an [[experiments/made by me/player/open-source human experiment\|open-source human experiment]].

#### what will i begin by streaming?

1) portfolio (enabling wider understanding/collaboration)
2) (top-down) core questions/research/thesis/projects vs (bottom-up) ideas/insights/experiments/prototypes
3) action via the life management methodology
