#### about

when we're talking about [[_004_L1F3/core concepts/self-transformation\|self-transformation]], [[_004_L1F3/core concepts/life design\|life design]] and [[_004_L1F3/core concepts/civilization design\|civilization design]], the systems we're embedded in are like the water we swim in. the [[models & frameworks/player/fourgames\|fourgames]] framework provides a good introduction to it, from an individual's perspective.

[[models & frameworks/design/holistic cultural materialism\|holistic cultural materialism]] also does it from a civilizational perspective.

[TfT in your OODA loop](https://subconscious.substack.com/p/tools-for-thought-in-your-ooda-loop) (conceptually)

[[projects & tools/projects/lab/subconscious (tool)\|subconscious (tool)]]/[[noosphere\|noosphere]] (-> https://utopia.rosano.ca/interoperable-visions / https://beepb00p.xyz/sad-infra.html) - there are 2 approaches:

these are basically more advanced [[_004_L1F3/core concepts/life management\|life management]] (and sometimes - [[topics/lab/quantified self\|quantified self]]) setups, going beyond what most advanced [[topics/lab/personal knowledge management\|PKM]] practitioners do, but still mostly concerned with [[topics/lab/personal data management\|personal data management]], and not necessarily [[_004_L1F3/core concepts/life design\|regenerative life]] / [[concepts/design/systems design\|systems design]].
