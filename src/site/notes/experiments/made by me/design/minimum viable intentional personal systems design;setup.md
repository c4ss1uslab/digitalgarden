#### about

this [[_001_MOCs/050 ðŸŸ© mid game/090 ðŸ§ª experiments MOC\|experiment]]/[[_001_MOCs/000 ðŸŸ£ deep game/015 âœ¨ heuristics & inquiries MOC\|inquiry]] intends to clarify and answer a few questions:

- what are the fundamental systems that underline one's life?
- what systems have the most impact/leverage on one's life?
- what's the role of technology in enabling intentional personal systems?
- how should one design their personal systems? what should be their design principles?
- what are state of the art personal systems setups? what values do they reflect/enact?
- what other possibilities are there for personal systems design?

and a few others that arise as we dive into this exploration.

as i gather/develop perspectives and resources, the idea of the [[_001_MOCs/050 ðŸŸ© mid game/090 ðŸ§ª experiments MOC\|experiment]] is to prototype and test this for myself, and then share results that might inform an actual open-source [[_001_MOCs/050 ðŸŸ© mid game/070 ðŸ”© prototypes MOC\|prototype]].

#### intro

when we're talking about [[_003_L1F3/core concepts/self-transformation\|self-transformation]], [[_003_L1F3/core concepts/life design\|life design]] and [[_003_L1F3/core concepts/civilization design\|civilization design]], the systems we're embedded in are like the water we swim in. a few lenses just to get an introduction to it:

although not solely focused on a "systems" language, [[topics/design/ontological design\|ontological design]] and [[models & frameworks/player/fourgames\|fourgames]] provide good introductions to it the main areas/systems pervading one's life, from an individual's perspective.

[[models & frameworks/design/social layers' pace\|social layers' pace]] and [[models & frameworks/design/holistic cultural materialism\|holistic cultural materialism]] also do so from a civilizational perspective.

#### working definitions

my loose ontology:

**personal:** [[sensing systems\|sensing]], [[sensemaking systems\|sensemaking]], [[decision-making systems\|decision-making]], [[concepts/design/action systems\|action systems]], [[learning systems\|learning systems]] & [[_003_L1F3/L1F3 support systems\|support systems]].

**civilizational:** [[self-management systems\|self-management]], [[organizational systems\|organizational]], [[diagnosis/self-terminating economic system\|economic]], [[topics/design/governance systems\|governance]], [[technological systems\|technological]] & [[terms/natural systems\|natural systems]].

#### core references for deepening inquiry:

[TfT in your OODA loop](https://subconscious.substack.com/p/tools-for-thought-in-your-ooda-loop) (conceptually)

[[projects & tools/projects/lab/subconscious (tool)\|subconscious (tool)]]/[[noosphere\|noosphere]] (-> https://utopia.rosano.ca/interoperable-visions / https://beepb00p.xyz/sad-infra.html) - there are 2 approaches:

these are basically more advanced [[_003_L1F3/core concepts/life management\|life management]] (and sometimes - [[topics/lab/quantified self\|quantified self]]) setups, going beyond what most advanced [[topics/lab/personal knowledge management\|PKM]] practitioners do, but still mostly concerned with [[topics/lab/personal data management\|personal data management]], and not necessarily [[_003_L1F3/core concepts/life design\|regenerative life]] / [[concepts/design/systems design\|systems design]].
