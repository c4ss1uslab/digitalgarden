see: [[digital environment design\|digital environment design]]

#### about

this has been a long-standing research/experiment of mine as to what is the minimum set of viable digital technologies ([[concepts/lab/personal tech stack\|personal tech stack]]) for an [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1us’ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/archive/databases/professional quadrants/intentional\|intentional]] [[personal computing\|personal computing]] setup.

we're talking [[desktop\|desktop]], [[mobile\|mobile]] and everything in-between.

most [[open-source\|open-source]]/[[local-first\|local-first]] apps and solutions are too technical/inaccessible for the average user, plus suffer from a much lower-quality UX and lack of development/support (mainly, of course, due to the pretty much non-existent [[topics/design/financial incentives for open-source software\|financial incentives for open-source software]]).

yet i believe we drastically need to give users more [[concepts/alchemy/agency\|agency]] and [[concepts/alchemy/sovereignty\|sovereignty]] over their own data and [[personal systems design\|personal systems design]].

lots of [[topics/design/web3\|web3]] initiatives aim to tackle this in different ways, i've experimented with and follow the development of a bunch of them ([[projects & tools/tools/design/IPFS\|IPFS]], [[initiatives, orgs & communities/lab/holochain\|holochain]], [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1us’ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/archive/databases/sub-interests & practices master list/urbit/urbit\|urbit]], even [[initiatives, orgs & communities/design/gitcoin\|gitcoin]] itself...) but there are still many bottlenecks, unsolved technical challenges and economic incentives for them to really start replacing standard web2 infrastructure existent today.

i also find the whole [[topics/lab/free open-source software\|free open-source software]] and [[humane tech\|humane tech]] movements (unfortunately) still very limited in their scopes.

### setup under consideration

in 2020, i created a (now outdated) [[prototypes & designs/made by me/notion personal tech stack database\|notion personal tech stack database]] as part of the [[projects & tools/made by me/notion life management system\|notion life management system]]. i will eventually update it with my most recent curation and setup, especially as i move it to [[projects & tools/tools/lab/anytype\|anytype]] or some other form of user-owned local software that does [[relational database\|relational database]] management (possibly [[projects & tools/tools/lab/obsidian\|obsidian]]/[[projects & tools/tools/lab/logseq\|logseq]]/[[dendron\|dendron]] with plugins, or a custom solution in the future).

for now, i'm compiling the tools i've seen/wanted to test here and will slowly adding metadata to them.
