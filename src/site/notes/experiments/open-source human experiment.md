since 2019, i've been structuring my whole life to be open-source and streamed in real-time using the [[l1f3 streaming system\|l1f3 streaming system]].

*i.e. i want pretty much everything i do to be public*, to varying accessibility degrees, so my life itself can be an experiment into how much this kind of shareability can help with [[self-discovery\|self-discovery]], [[collaboration\|collaboration]] and positive [[impact\|impact]] on others.

in order to do that, i'm doing my best to make my own life an open-source mvp sharing a [[experiments/minimum viable intentional personal systems setup\|minimum viable intentional personal systems setup]] using the [[_003_L1F3/l1f3 management methodology\|L1F3 management framework]].

most of what i've been tracking/implementing still isn't live, but the direction is to have a modular real-time page/dashboard, [[quantified self\|quantified self]]-like, similar to [how is felix today?](https://howisfelix.today/), but with less focus on [[personal metrics\|personal metrics]] and more on data/information relevant for [[collaboration\|collaboration]] and [[impact\|impact]].

the challenges of building it are many, as very well presented in articles such as https://beepb00p.xyz/sad-infra.html, https://jon.bo/posts/digital-tools/ and https://utopia.rosano.ca/interoperable-visions/, but i've been slowly doing it with bits and pieces from here and there.

once this project is live, i'll update here with more details on my setup.
