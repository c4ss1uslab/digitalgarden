since 2019, i've been structuring my whole life to be open-source and streamed in real-time using the [[_004_L1F3/l1f3 streaming system\|l1f3 streaming system]].

*i.e. i want pretty much everything i do to be public*, to varying accessibility degrees, so my life itself can be an experiment into how much this kind of shareability can help with [[self-discovery\|self-discovery]], [[terms/collaboration\|collaboration]] and positive [[terms/impact\|impact]] on others.

one obvious challenge this brings up is potential [[adversarial relationships\|adversarial relationships]] and [[exploitative dynamics\|exploitative dynamics]]. i won't address this fully here, but for now, i'm betting that pros outweigh the cons and that's why there are accessibility levels. they're not "bought", but built based on [[initiatives, orgs & communities/architect;design/trust network\|trust networks]]. more on this later.

in order to get this experiment going, i've been slowly building up an mvp by sharing a [[experiments/minimum viable intentional personal systems setup\|minimum viable intentional personal systems setup]] and [[experiments/minimum viable personal tech stack;setup\|tech stack;setup]], using the [[_004_L1F3/l1f3 management methodology\|L1F3 management framework]].

most of what i've been tracking/implementing still isn't live, but the direction is to have a modular real-time page/dashboard, [[topics/lab/quantified self\|quantified self]]-like, similar to [how is felix today?](https://howisfelix.today/), but with less focus on [[personal metrics\|personal metrics]] and more on data/information relevant for [[terms/collaboration\|collaboration]] and [[terms/impact\|impact]].

the challenges of building it are many, as very well presented in articles such as [the sad state of personal data and infrastructure](https://beepb00p.xyz/sad-infra.html), [digital tools i wish existed](https://jon.bo/posts/digital-tools/) and [interoperable visions](https://utopia.rosano.ca/interoperable-visions/), but i've been slowly doing it with bits and pieces from here and there.

once this project is live, i'll update here with more details on my setup.
