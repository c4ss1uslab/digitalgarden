##### an introduction to prevailing and emergent design philosophies

core reading: [Technology is Not Values Neutral: Ending the Reign of Nihilistic Design](https://consilienceproject.org/technology-is-not-values-neutral-ending-the-reign-of-nihilistic-design-2/) - [[initiatives, orgs & communities/design/the consilience project\|the consilience project]]

see also: [[projects & tools/projects/design/diome.xyz\|diome.xyz]]'s note on [more-than-human-centered-design](https://diome.xyz/2+%F0%9F%8C%BF+Leaves/More-Than-Human-Centered+Design) for how/why "putting users first" is often causing more problems ([[externalities\|externalities]]) than doing "good".

##### a few other approaches that have influenced me most:

[[responses/design/axiological design\|axiological design]] / [[responses/design/values-based design\|values-and-meaning based design]]
[[responses/design/conscious design\|conscious design]]
[[responses/regen/regenerative design\|regenerative design]] / [[concepts/design/circular design\|circular design]]
[[models & frameworks/design/humane design\|humane design]] / [[human-centered design\|human-centered design]]
[[concepts/design/agent-centric design\|agent-centric design]]
[[topics/design/ontological design\|ontological design]]

\+ currently learning more about:
- [[models & frameworks/design/metadesign\|metadesign]]
- [[concepts/design/complexity\|complexity]]-informed / [[topics/design/holonic design\|holonic]] / [[concepts/regen/biomimicry\|biomimetic]] / living systems design

i see all of these approaches - some more robust and academic, some more early-stage - as valid, important and powerful, and a combination of them as necessary for different contexts - which i like to represent using the [[models & frameworks/design/three horizons\|three horizons]] framework.

in the short-term (h1), we need a lot more [[concepts/design/circular design\|circular]], [[responses/regen/regenerative design\|regenerative]], [[models & frameworks/design/humane design\|humane]] and [[responses/design/values-based design\|values-and-meaning based design]]. as we move towards h2, i believe [[concepts/design/agent-centric design\|agent-centric design]] will grow even more important, as a way to protect and support communities for navigating [[concepts/design/the great simplification\|the great simplification]]. and well into h2-h3, a resurgence of cybernetics, new forms of questioning, relating and designing technologies with an account for [[externalities\|externalities]], [[planetary boundaries\|planetary boundaries]] and the role of [[topics/design/technology\|technology]] will become even more important, reconsidering the depth and vast space of technological possibilities from [[topics/design/ontological design\|ontological]], [[concepts/regen/biomimicry\|biomimetic]] and [[models & frameworks/design/metadesign\|metadesign]] methodologies.

when we're talking about [[software\|software]] architecture, i often align with the [[local-first\|local-first]], [[terms/privacy\|privacy]]-preserving, [[credible exit\|credible exit]], [[modularity\|modularity]], [[interoperability\|interoperability]] ideals/standards in the [[topics/lab/free open-source software\|FOSS]] community, but with a strong consideration of [[risks\|risks]] and [[externalities\|externalities]], especially from [[bioweapons\|bioweapons]], [[topics/lab/artificial intelligence\|AI]], [[nanotech\|nanotech]], etc... which is a challenging balance that can hopefully be addressed by a deep restructuration of our [[diagnosis/self-terminating economic system\|self-terminating economic system]] and emergent approaches in [[topics/design/governance systems\|governance]]/[[epistemic systems\|epistemic systems]] such as the ones suggested by [[initiatives, orgs & communities/design/the consilience project\|the consilience project]] and projects such as [[initiatives, orgs & communities/lab/ezkl\|ezkl]], [[initiatives, orgs & communities/design/common sensemakers\|common sensemakers]], [[initiatives, orgs & communities/design/open civics\|open civics]] and [[initiatives, orgs & communities/design/the society library\|the society library]].

##### what constitutes a design philosophy?

in the book, [[references/alchemy/first principles and first values\|first principles and first values - forty-two propositions on cosmoerotic humanism, the meta-crisis and the world to come]], the authors propose that any complete (whole) philosophy presents a [[terms/cosmology\|cosmology]], an [[concepts/alchemy/epistemology\|epistemology]], an [[concepts/alchemy/ontology\|ontology]] and an [[concepts/alchemy/axiology\|axiology]].

all of these elements of a culture or worldview are embedded into any artifact it produces. therefore, any design philosophy, if not clearly stating their stance, are inheriting such presuppositions from the overarching culture they're embedded in.

##### my take on it
