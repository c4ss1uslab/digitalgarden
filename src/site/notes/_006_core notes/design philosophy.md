great critical take/intro to existing design philosophies: https://consilienceproject.org/technology-is-not-values-neutral-ending-the-reign-of-nihilistic-design-2/

##### approaches that have influenced me most:
[[concepts/circular design\|circular design]]
[[models & frameworks/human-centered design\|human-centered design]]
[[concepts/values-based design\|values-and-meaning based design]]
[[concepts/regenerative design\|regenerative design]]
[[metadesign\|metadesign]]
[[topics/architect;design/ontological design\|ontological design]]

when we're talking about [[software\|software]] architecture, i often align with the [[local-first\|local-first]], [[terms/privacy\|privacy]]-preserving, [[credible exit\|credible exit]], [[modularity\|modularity]], [[interoperability\|interoperability]] ideals/standards in the [[topics/lab/free open-source software\|FOSS]] community, but with a strong consideration of [[risks\|risks]] and [[externalities\|externalities]] from [[bioweapons\|bioweapons]], [[topics/lab/artificial intelligence\|AI]], [[nanotech\|nanotech]], etc...

there's also [[agent-centric design\|agent-centric design]]/[[biomimicry\|biomimetic]] design proposed by [[initiatives, orgs & communities/lab/holochain\|holochain]]. and a few others less clearly articulated proposed by [[projects & tools/tools/design/IPFS\|IPFS]], [[solid\|solid]] and a few other [[dweb\|dweb]] proponents.

##### what constitutes a design philosophy?

in the book, [[first principles and first values - forty-two propositions on cosmoerotic humanism, the meta-crisis and the world to come\|first principles and first values - forty-two propositions on cosmoerotic humanism, the meta-crisis and the world to come]], the authors propose that any complete (whole) philosophy presents a [[cosmology\|cosmology]], an [[epistemology\|epistemology]], an [[ontology\|ontology]] and an [[axiology\|axiology]].

all of these elements of a culture or worldview are embedded into any artifact it produces. therefore, any design philosophy, if not clearly stating their stance, are inheriting such presuppositions from the overarching culture they're embedded in.

##### my take on it
