> i believe most, if not all, of one's most important aspects of their lives can be managed through the set of categories below. the idea of proposing this ontology is to make it easier to manage the [[concepts/design/complexity\|complexity]] of our lives and to communicate about it. this systematizing aims to enable deeper levels of [[understanding\|understanding]], [[visibility\|visibility]] and [[coordination\|coordination]] across [[worldviews\|worldviews]], [[_003_L1F3/core concepts/lifestyles\|lifestyles]] and [[metagames\|metagames]].

#### how this came to be & where it's going

when i was 15 years old, i started constantly asking myself - is there an "optimal" or "best" way to live my life? what would that look like?

as any teenager, i was basically in search of a [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1us’ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/archive/databases/superskills master list/philosophy\|philosophy]]. but i wasn't interested in just [[ethics\|ethics]], [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1us’ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/archive/databases/general skills master list/aesthetics\|aesthetics]] or [[topics/alchemy/metaphysics\|metaphysics]], i wanted to know how i should practically design/organize/manage my life as well, in order to live in integrity with that.

this question led me to several different perspectives, based on different [[philosophical\|philosophical]] stances, which had very practical consequences. lots of people have created [[digital productivity\|digital productivity]] setups and [[topics/lab/personal knowledge management\|personal knowledge management]] systems (as i share my major influences below), but most of them don't ever question deeply held conventional western-centric, [[Modernism\|modern]] worldviews.

i started this investigation in 2015 from a very conventional worldview, by attempting to implement [[_005_MOCs/000 🟣 deep game/010 💠 values & principles MOC\|principles]], [[_005_MOCs/000 🟣 deep game/015 ✨ heuristics & inquiries MOC\|heuristics]] and [[topics/alchemy/mental models\|mental models]] from references like [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1us’ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/archive/databases/organizations master list/farnam street\|farnam street]], [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1us’ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/bookmarks/Wait But Why\|wait but why]] and [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1us’ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/archive/databases/contacts master list/contacts master list/tim ferriss\|tim ferriss]], and the most structured of them - [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1us’ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/archive/databases/content master list/the last safe investment\|the last safe investment]]'s [[models & frameworks/player/S.A.F.E. plan\|S.A.F.E. plan]] into systems and frameworks such as [[david allen\|david allen]]'s [[models & frameworks/lab/getting things done\|getting things done]], [[zettelkasten\|zettelkasten]], [[leo babauta\|leo babauta]]'s [[zen to done\|zen to done]], [[taylor pearson\|taylor pearson]]'s [[purposeful productivity\|purposeful productivity]]. (this was before many contemporary "business gurus" such as [[naval ravikant\|naval ravikant]], [[andrew huberman\|andrew huberman]], [[lex fridman\|lex fridman]] and others have risen in popular culture.)

this evolved through my own work in 2018 when i was learning/working with [[people/references/alchemy/gabriel goffi\|gabriel goffi]] on the [[projects & tools/projects/design/24h system\|24h system]], when i got introduced to several key figures in [[topics/alchemy/spirituality\|spirituality]] and [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1us’ notion/50.000ft - core/decision management system/self-investment methodology/skills breakdown/Copy of personal clarity/big picture world understanding/consciousness expansion\|consciousness expansion]], and then in the following years when i dove into [[people/references/lab/tiago forte\|tiago forte]]'s [[patterns/active patterns/knowledge management/building a second brain\|BASB]] ([[patterns/active patterns/knowledge management/building a second brain\|building a second brain]]), [[august bradley\|august bradley]]'s [[models & frameworks/lab/pillars, pipelines & vaults\|pillars, pipelines & vaults]], [[people/references/lab/nick milo\|nick milo]]'s [[LYT\|LYT]], [[tbprocessed/base notes/people/zsolt viczián\|zsolt viczián]]'s [[visual knowledge management system\|visual knowledge management system]].

([[people/references/lab/tiago forte\|tiago forte]] and [[people/references/lab/anne-laure le cunff\|people/references/lab/anne-laure le cunff]], two influential people in the [[topics/lab/personal knowledge management\|PKM]] field, have flirted with [[responses/alchemy/metamodernism\|metamodern]] ideas, as shared in anne-laure's [An introduction to metamodernism: the cultural philosophy of the digital age](https://nesslabs.com/metamodernism)  and tiago's numerous accounts of his [transformative experiences](https://fortelabs.com/blog/a-quest-for-self-knowledge-from-self-help-to-somatic-healing-part-i-opening-my-mind/). but from what i can tell, they're still mostly centered in a rationalist perspective for navigating life - and managing it.)

deeper than that, these references introduced me to the original research in the field of [[responses/lab/tools for thought\|tools for thought]], plus the current initiatives and developments which have come up with several [[patterns/pattern collections/knowledge design patterns\|knowledge design frameworks and patterns]] that add rich perspectives to the pile.

now, most of these are still very much in the tech-oriented/[[responses/lab/knowledge management\|knowledge management]] space. managing life isn't just managing knowledge (as seen in the [[models & frameworks/design/DIKW pyramid\|DIKW pyramid]]), so once again looking from perspectives from other disciplines, in 2019 i discovered [[people/references/alchemy/ken wilber\|ken wilber]]'s work on [[responses/alchemy/integral theory\|integral theory]] and the [[references/alchemy/integral OS\|integral OS]], and they soon came to be a cornerstone in everything i do.

in early 2022 my vision was amplified by [[people/friends/ísis schuarts\|ísis schuarts]]' vision for [[_003_L1F3/L1F3.stream\|L1F3.stream]] and the [[_003_L1F3/l1f3 manager\|l1f3 manager]], which had some fair bit of influence from spiritual studies of [[law of time\|law of time]], [[allan kardec\|allan kardec]], the [[essenes\|essenes]], [[gnosticism\|gnosticism]] and other [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1us’ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/archive/databases/sub-interests & practices master list/ayahuasca\|ayahuasca]] communities (which i didn't want to dive fully in, to not get too esoteric), but also it had some very practical collaborative [[_003_L1F3/core concepts/life design\|life design]] implementations in its systems.

add this to my own inspirations from many modern [[coaching\|coaching]] practices and ancestral [[orientation devices\|orientation devices]] such as the [[i-ching\|i-ching]], [[mahalila\|mahalila]], [[practices/tarot\|tarot]], and other [[therapeutic modalities\|therapeutic modalities]]... and the bunch of powerful [[topics/player/game interfaces\|game interfaces]]/[[patterns/pattern collections/game design patterns\|game design patterns]] present in current-day games, as well as [[tbprocessed/notion/projects overview/🧿 macro overview/l1f3 game/metagame\|metagame]] frameworks such as [[rodrigo arantes\|rodrigo arantes]]' [[a jogada\|a jogada]], [[jamie combs\|jamie combs]]' [[models & frameworks/player/fourgames\|fourgames]]...

finally, integrating all of these references, around 2022, 7 years after the beginning of this investigation, i started to have glimpses of a "*life management ontology*" (or methodology) that integrated all of these perspectives and that seemed to work for me.

while going through all these references, i kept constantly questioning myself:

> what are or "should be" the design primitives of [[_003_L1F3/core concepts/life management\|life management]]?
> what are the fundamental ways in which we see, relate to and engage with reality?
> what are the fundamental tools that we use to do so?

instead of assuming a bunch of premises widely accepted in modern culture (and just "get on with these simple productivity apps/tricks"), this inquiry clearly came from an inner place of strong dissonance - what's being talked about in media, how "normal lives" are being lived feels off. that's not what i believe in and want for my life.

so this necessarily crosses into deeper [[topics/alchemy/metaphysics\|metaphysical]], [[concepts/alchemy/epistemology\|epistemological]], [[concepts/alchemy/ontology\|ontological]], [[concepts/alchemy/axiology\|axiological]] territory. the [[concepts/design/metacrisis\|metacrisis]] references i bring up explore this in depth.

my inquiry remained: how can i create something that is grounded in reality, that is systemic, modular, non-dogmatic, interoperable, fully extensible, customizable and [[topics/design/regeneration\|regenerative]] by design?

very wordy and challenging, yes. but necessary nonetheless.

i wanted it to be minimally opinionated, yet i found the [[topics/design/regeneration\|regenerative]] frame to be a key difference between meaninglessness and unconsciously damaging behaviors to ways of living that are more conscious and life-affirming, so i opted to keep it.

as it's intended to be modular, the ontology of the framework itself is under constant development, but the initial core principles/structures are set in place.

over time i learned that any effective design must include several elements - from practical [[_005_MOCs/050 🟩 mid game/080 ⚒ tools MOC\|tools]] and [[ecologies of practices\|ecologies of practices]], to clarified [[_005_MOCs/000 🟣 deep game/010 💠 values & principles MOC\|principles]], [[_005_MOCs/000 🟣 deep game/015 ✨ heuristics & inquiries MOC\|heuristics]], [[topics/alchemy/mental models\|mental models]], [[topics/design/systems\|systems]], [[topics/lab/algorithms\|algorithms]] and [[design patterns\|design patterns]]. my aim is to introduce them here.
