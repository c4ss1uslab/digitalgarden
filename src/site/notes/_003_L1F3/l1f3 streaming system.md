#### introduction

streaming, in the most usual sense, is referred to [[video streaming\|video streaming]], something mostly gamers do. my use of the term is related to that - it's about streaming something, but not necessarily video. my take on "streaming" understands "streams" as flows - value flows, information flows, any kind of flow, just like [[concepts/design/currencies\|currencies]] can be seen as current-sees (i.e. the visualization of [[initiatives, orgs & communities/design/valueflows\|value flows]])

and in my understanding of the [[concepts/design/metacrisis\|metacrisis]], a great deal of our societal problems has to do with a [[concepts/design/flow crisis\|flow crisis]] - i.e. perverse [[concepts/design/incentive structures\|incentive structures]] designed for [[diagnosis/accumulation, extraction, abstraction\|accumulation, extraction, abstraction]] generating persistent [[concepts/design/coordination failure\|coordination failure]] and a system that resists very hardly to any kind of [[omni-considerate design\|omni-considerate design]].

so what do we constantly stream in our lives? the obvious one is money. but we also do information, all the time, in social media, conversations or messaging apps. there are many other things - food, material items, even time/energy into activities, organizations, relationships. our lives are made up of constant flows coming in and out.

a good way to start looking at this is through the different [[models & frameworks/design/8 forms of capital\|types of capital]].

therefore,

> how can we design our lives to better stream these flows in more conscious, nurturing, regenerative ways?

that's what this project is all about.
