### definition

the way i use the term "life support system" is: *"any crucial system(s) within a habitat that are responsible for maintaining the survival of a certain species"*.

if we apply that for humans, there are many [[terms/natural systems\|natural]] and [[built systems\|built systems]] on [[terms/earth\|earth]] that support our life on this planet.

differently, a "L1F3 support system" is: *"any crucial system(s) within a habitat that are responsible for supporting the [[concepts/alchemy/thriving\|thriving]] of a certain species"*. so they both [[transcend and include\|transcend and include]] all systems that are responsible for maintaining our survival.

> \**ps: knowing of our human [[interdependence\|interdependence]] with nature, here we must include our [[circle of concern\|circle of concern]] towards all other living beings as well - our thriving isn't real unless others' are also taken into account.*

given this explanation, hopefully i don't have to explain why [[_003_L1F3/L1F3 support systems\|L1F3 support systems]] matter. :)

see: [[concepts/alchemy/thriving\|thriving]] for a detailed discussion on how i use term, attempting to account for [[externalities\|externalities]] and carefully considering [[health metrics\|health]]/[[success metrics\|success metrics]].

given this definition, an exorbitant number of known and unknown systems classify as [[_003_L1F3/L1F3 support systems\|L1F3 support systems]]. how do we classify/navigate this?

**for now, we'll focus our discussion around [[meta-systems\|meta-systems]].**

i'll introduce an ontology and a few suggestions for further research/classification later.

### L1F3 support meta-systems

based on this concept, the [[L1F3 support meta-systems\|L1F3 support meta-systems]] i've been most focused on are a mix of speculative design projects with very practical [[_001_MOCs/050 ðŸŸ© mid game/090 ðŸ§ª experiments MOC\|experiments]]/[[_001_MOCs/050 ðŸŸ© mid game/070 ðŸ”© prototypes MOC\|prototypes]] i'm developing in their directions.

much more work and refinement is needed, my intent with the parts i've already been working on is to merely establish some of the conceptual/practical research foundations for building the systems themselves.

the major systems i have been designing/prototyping for a long time are:

1) [[_003_L1F3/l1f3 game\|L1F3.GAME]]

2) [[_003_L1F3/l1f3 management system\|L1F3 management system]]

3) [[_004_L1F3/l1f3 operating system\|L1F3 operating system]]

4) [[_003_L1F3/l1f3 player system\|L1F3 player system]]

5) [[_003_L1F3/l1f3 streaming system\|L1F3 streaming system]]

i introduce each of them individually in their own pages.

### their components & development stage

you can go into each one of these pages to dissect each system, but i also wanted to give you a big picture view at how much i was able to progress in building each of them and their sub-parts. there are so many important pieces that i couldn't keep prioritizing building them on my own.

everything i built (below) is just so hopefully you get a taste/vision of what they look/feel like, and if it resonates, we have a long way ahead to keep co-creating. :)

here's how much i progressed in each of them:

#### prototype stage

[[_004_toolkit/000 â›“ l1f3 player toolkit\|l1f3 player toolkit]]

#### experiment stage

[[minimum viable intentional OS\|minimum viable intentional OS]] -> [[responses/lab/personal OS design\|OS of the future]]

#### design stage
