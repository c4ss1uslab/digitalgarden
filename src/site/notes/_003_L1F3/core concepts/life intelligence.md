just like businesses need to make analyses, situational assessments and use/develop other tools for better [[concepts/alchemy/sensemaking\|sensemaking]] and [[terms/decision-making\|decision-making]] to remain relevant in their field and achieve their strategic goals, so do we need as individuals if we want to be relevant in our field of play, find resonant [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1us’ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/archive/1 - on hold-waiting for/Porter's Generic Strategies - Choosing Your Route to Success/Untitled/Opportunities\|opportunities]] and have an impact on others.

in many ways, personal life is different from business. we don't want to narrow-boundary optimize everything. however, analyzing where these corporate/organizational tools - that have been found to be consistently useful in this wider competitive social context - can be useful for us and leveraging them for their best possible use, is in my opinion a responsibility of any spiritually/ethically-inclined person trying to be of service to life and have an influence in the [[concepts/design/metacrisis\|metacrisis]].

a few main [[business intelligence\|business intelligence]] references that can be very translatable/applicable to personal life: [[models & frameworks/design/wardley mapping\|wardley mapping]]⁹⁰, [[projects & tools/tools/design/sensemaker\|sensemaker]]/[[dave snowden\|dave snowden]], [[bismarck analysis\|bismarck analysis]], [[models & frameworks/design/metadesign\|metadesign]]'s cognitive/mapping tools.

i.e. **how do we create systems/tools that support us, as individuals and (loosely-associated) collectives, to make better, strategic decisions towards more beautiful, desirable futures\*?**

\*for a discussion on desirable futures, see: [[concepts/design/impact metrics\|wide-boundary metrics]].

##### what are most popular existing life intelligence support systems/tools?

a few common approaches:

by creating:
[[responses/lab/knowledge commons\|knowledge commons]] (publications, think tanks, research institutes, media companies, etc)
[[technological commons\|technological commons]] (building tools to support personal/collective [[sensing\|sensing]], [[concepts/alchemy/sensemaking\|sensemaking]], [[terms/decision-making\|decision-making]], [[_005_MOCs/075 🔴🟠🟡 short game/100 💪🏻 actions MOC\|action]], [[_005_MOCs/075 🔴🟠🟡 short game/098 📕 learning MOC\|learning]])
e.g.: most [[topics/lab/free open-source software\|free open-source software]], many [[topics/design/web3\|web3]]/[[terms/blockchain\|blockchain]] projects, [[concepts/design/collective intelligence\|collective intelligence]] projects like - a few of my favorites: [[initiatives, orgs & communities/design/sublime (ex-startupy)\|sublime]], [[initiatives, orgs & communities/design/golden\|golden]], [[initiatives, orgs & communities/design/goodly labs\|goodly labs]], [[tbprocessed/notion/c4ss1us’ notion/50.000ft - core/knowledge management system/archive/databases/sub-missions list/disruptive life OS v. 1.0/disruptive os breakdown/personal ecosystems creation/intrapersonal management/learning-education resources/alternative education companies database/roote\|roote]] (with [[projects & tools/projects/lab/trails.social (ex-tweetscape)\|trails.social (ex-tweetscape)]]), [[projects & tools/tools/lab/pol.is\|pol.is]], etc.
[[group intelligence\|group intelligence]] (fellowships, courses, events, communities, facilitated sessions, etc)
