the L1F3 game is a massively-multiplayer online-and-offline collaborative self-transformation & civilization-building game under development.

oriented towards building more [[conscious\|conscious]], [[fun\|fun]], [[collaborative\|collaborative]], [[regenerative\|regenerative]] and [[disruptive\|disruptive]] [[systems\|systems]] - for addressing our [[concepts/metacrisis\|personal and civilizational crises]] and supporting/challenging us on our path towards [[tbprocessed/base notes/concepts - general/conscious evolution\|conscious evolution]].

for the sake of resilience, values-alignment and accessibility, it's being built on top of [[_003_L1F3/l1f3 protocol\|an open-source, distributed, modular, interoperable protocol for playing life - individually and together]].

#### definitions

the L1F3 game exists so we can play life in more conscious, collaborative, impactful, fun, regenerative ways.

play is both an attitude and an [[action\|action]], it happens at all levels above [[data\|data]], [[information\|information]] and [[knowledge\|knowledge]]. considering the [[OODA loop\|OODA loop]], to play is an agreement, a decision that transforms your whole loop - it changes how you observe, orient, decide and act moving forward.

[[models & frameworks/fourgames\|fourgames]] introduces a simple yet profound lens for how [[life is play\|life is play]]. the games we are always playing and can choose to be more conscious of.

ancient [[spiritual lineages\|wisdom traditions]] also do so by saying that life is a [[lila\|lila]], [[maya\|maya]], yet also a journey of [[tbprocessed/base notes/concepts - general/conscious evolution\|conscious evolution]].

[[indigenous wisdom\|indigenous wisdom]] might state that life is about [[learning\|learning]], [[creation\|creating]], [[healing\|healing]], [[sharing\|sharing]], [[play\|playing]]. and meta-theorists such as [[ken wilber\|ken wilber]] encapsulate it as [[waking up\|waking up]], [[growing up\|growing up]], [[cleaning up\|cleaning up]], [[showing up\|showing up]], [[opening up\|opening up]]. 

[[cyberneticians\|cyberneticians]] might use the [[OODA loop\|OODA loop]] often, using the [[sensing\|sensing]], [[tbprocessed/base notes/concepts - general/sensemaking\|sensemaking]], [[decision-making\|decision-making]], [[action\|action]], [[learning\|learning]] loops to study the [[patterns of living systems\|patterns of living systems]] and do [[complexity-informed design\|complexity-informed design]].

[[regenerative designers\|regenerative designers]] (ana), [[cognitive scientists\|cognitive scientists]] -> [[relevance realization\|relevance realization]] and [[reciprocal narrowing\|reciprocal narrowing]]...

i ([[tbprocessed/working on/[3Q; IC] - planning;communication/c4ss1us\|c4ss1us]]) might say: let's build systems to enable deeper levels of [[collaboration\|collaboration]], [[coordination\|coordination]], [[design\|design]] and [[self-transformation\|self-transformation]] in life!

many other philosophers, anthropologists, researchers, historians, educators, biologists, and people from all fields, backgrounds and journeys also have their valuable perspectives to add...

how do we hold space for all these perspectives, and more to come?

[[_003_L1F3/l1f3 protocol\|L1F3 protocol]] is an experimental interoperability protocol for perspectives - testing, evaluating, taking, changing and creating.

### what's a minimum viable game that's stimulating & empowering?
the game of flow.

flow lives in between challenge and comfort.

-> take actions that push me out of my box/comfort zone but that are not too challenging.
-> face fear, regain my confidence, discover and own more of my hidden/locked/blocked power.

#### important clarification questions

###### Q: what's the difference between this and some "life gamification app"?

in short, the level of responsibility. in most [[gamification\|gamification]] products or apps, there are clearly distinct roles of [[game designer\|game]]/[[product designers\|product designers]] and [[users\|users]]/[[players\|players]].

in real life, everyone is co-creating reality. [[_003_L1F3/L1F3 game\|L1F3 game]] isn't some product you buy and use, it's something you co-create by participating. you are at the same time the [[designer\|designer]] and the [[player\|player]] of your own life (and its games).

there's a huge difference in the mindset, and therefore, in how we act, play, and experience reality itself. if we recognize that life is a [[tbprocessed/base notes/ventures - general/meta-game\|meta-game]], and opt for co-designing it, we have way more [[sovereignty\|sovereignty]] and [[agency\|agency]].

that's the proposal of the [[_003_L1F3/L1F3 game\|L1F3 game]], as well as other [[serious life games\|serious life games]].

###### Q: what's the difference between this and [[initiatives, orgs & communities/metagame.wtf\|metagame.wtf]]?

honestly, not much. i intend to collaborate/integrate as much as possible with them.

a few key differences are: they're more focused on building the [[web3\|web3]] infrastructure first and a more technically-oriented kind of play, instead of playing life in all its dimensions.

we're more focused on building community and narrative content first, so it can attract more than the tech-savvy/[[web3\|web3]] types and become a self-sustainable ecosystem able to support its players on their developmental journeys, so they can, among other things, build the necessary technological tools as well.

there's also a big challenge in [[web3\|web3]]/crypto space which is the design of conscious/sustainable/regenerative incentive structures. though there are great projects attempting to address this such as [[token engineering commons\|token engineering commons]], [[gitcoin\|gitcoin]] and [[better-than-free economies\|better-than-free economies]] such as [[tbprocessed/base notes/ventures - general/SEEDS (ecosystem)\|SEEDS]], i still believe it's a largely unsolved problem, with room for wild speculation and bad actors. so i'm a bit wary of investing a lot of energy into the project and it collapsing due to their tokenomics model.

**Q: what's the difference between this and [[projects & tools/startover.xyz\|startover.xyz]]?**

they're much more focused on internal transformation than the balance between internal and external contribution/expression, , while we're more oriented by [[integral theory\|integral theory]]'s distinctions of the [[concepts/four facets of integral development\|four facets of integral development]].

they're also more interested in furthering their own empirical research rather than integrating different [[spiritual lineages\|wisdom traditions]] and [[_000_MOCs/025 🔷 long game/025 🗺 topics & references MOC\|fields of knowledge]].

### introduction & background

this project has a long history, starting with [[my first spiritual realization\|my first spiritual realization]] in 2015 and catapulted by my work with [[ísis schuarts\|ísis schuarts]] at [[high stakes academy\|high stakes academy]] back in 2018 and many following experiences/prototypes.

but it can be boiled down to two questions:
##### what games are you already playing in life?
##### how can life be a game that's deeply nourishing & empowering for you, for others and for the planet?

one way we can begin to create that is by choosing to play a game of finding/aligning with one's own flow.

everyone has a unique energetic fingerprint, so finding out / aligning with yours is a lifelong mission.

but for starters, [[flow\|flow]] lives in between challenge and comfort.

for example, specifically, for me this means:
-> taking actions that push me out of my box/comfort zone but that are not too challenging.
-> facing fear, gaining confidence, discovering, owning and developing more of my hidden/locked/blocked powers.

what moves you?
